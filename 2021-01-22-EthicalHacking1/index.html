<h3 id="Why-Cybersecurity"><a href="#Why-Cybersecurity" class="headerlink" title="Why Cybersecurity?"></a>Why Cybersecurity?</h3><p>In the current scenario, where everything has shifted to internet, so is the crime that has also upgraded itself to <br><br>the cyberspace. Data is so cheap nowadays that each and every person has the access of internet easily. Therefore, a<br>common person has all his contact numbers, photos, videos, important documents, notes, playlists, reminders etc. as<br>a backup on the internet. Somehow if the device gets compromized then this “backup” can be missused in several ways<br>depending on the attacker.<br>Huge amount of data is present in <em>cyberspace</em> and also being added every hour. Have an idea with the following fact<br>that what happens across the word in 60 seconds</p>

<hr>
<p>Apart from above discussion, there are many other platforms on internet where people show their activity time to time.<br>Some of the data is confidential and some is open source. The Confidential data acts as the hack value, i.e. the hackers<br>are in need of such information that is not accessible by the unauthorized users and expect some ransom in return or<br>else they make it public, or missuse it to defame the owner of the information, which is a crime.<br>This brings the need of cybersecurity. This whole field deals with the various steps used by the cybersecurity personnel<br>in order to keep the cyberspace safe for the general public, to prevent the data from being accessed by unethical people,<br>and if it’s done then take the legal procedings against the attacker and fix the damages done by the attacker.</p>
<h3 id="Need-of-Ethical-Hackers"><a href="#Need-of-Ethical-Hackers" class="headerlink" title="Need of Ethical Hackers"></a>Need of Ethical Hackers</h3><p>The ethical hackers are the personnel who do hacking within the legal boundaries and don’t have intentions to harm anyone.<br>They help the organization by finding various vulnerabilities in their applications, websites and server; so that no one<br>could exploit any of those vulnerabilities and get control over the server or harm the organization in any other way.<br>For dealing with hackers the ethical hacker have to think like a black hat hackers(the attackers) and get into the server<br>by exploiting the vulnerabilities they found. Later they patch those vulnerabilities, discovered by them so that the<br>organization remains safe from any attacks. In general the hacking is done by performing following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Footprinting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scanning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enumeration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gaining access into system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maintaining that access</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clearing logs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A cybersecurity enthusiast and an ethical hacker knows a lot more than above six points. It’s not like if you have got<br>command somehow on these six points then you have mastered cybersecurity and have become an ethical hacker. The ethical<br>hacker and a cybersecurity personnel have to keep himself updated regarding the latest bug found, the latest case studies<br>related to any cyber crime, and also has the knowledge in the networking field. Linux is mandatory if you want to become<br>an ethical hacker. There are over 1000 commands in linux and each commannd has several options. It’s impossible to mugup<br>the commands in linux, rather you should have a hands-on practice with most of the commands. Afterall it’s all about practicing<br>things. In networking you should have the knowledge of atleast subnetting, IP addressing, TCP/OSI model, devices used in<br>establishing a network and various protocols. Means these concepts are the prerequisite for being an ethical hacker.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my upcoming blogs, the networking and linux’s basic concepts will not be covered. This series will be dedicated only to<br>the above six points and will be elaborated with all the tools and linux commands. If you are new to this and don’t have<br>any prior knowledge about networking and linux, not to worry about. Each point will be discussed in detail, and surely you<br>will find interesting stuffs related to hacking.</p>
