<p>In my last blog I discussed the techniques regarding how to perform enumeraation. We used Windows as well as<br>Linux tool to perform enumeration, and we were able to get some extra information about the target device. So<br>now we were able to perform footprinting, scanning, enumeration for the target, we have to start with the system<br>hacking. But before that we should now how to perform vulnerability assessment, because till now we have only gathered<br>the information about the target. What are the vulnerabilities, how to perform vulnerability assessment, all this we will<br>discuss now.</p>
<p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong><br>It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the<br>tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will<br>have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are<br>understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:</strong></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways</strong><br><strong>will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t</strong><br><strong>you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking</strong><br><strong>something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep</strong><br><strong>a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.</strong></p>

<h2 id="What-is-a-Vulnerability"><a href="#What-is-a-Vulnerability" class="headerlink" title="What is a Vulnerability"></a><u>What is a Vulnerability</u></h2><p>Vulnerability means weakness, or loopholes that are present in any system. So the system/device haing some vulnerabilities is known as<br>a vulnerable system. Why so? because that system/device is prone to attacks. These vulnerabilities can be due to the misconfigurations in<br>the device, such as misconfigured firewalls. And sometimes the device becomes vulnerable if some software/application starts doing malicious things<br>or it can be a backdoor too, which helps the attackers to get into the target device. These vulnerabilities help attacker to explit them and get<br>into the device. I will be discussing about malwares in upcoming blogs, but in this blog<br>we will see how we can do vulnerability assessment.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-Vulnerability-Research"><a href="#What-is-a-Vulnerability-Research" class="headerlink" title="What is a Vulnerability Research"></a><u>What is a Vulnerability Research</u></h2><p>Vulnerability research refers to identifying and discovering various vulnerablities which can lead to an attack to the vulnerable device. Goals of this research is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gathering information regarding various vulnerabiliies and their ways of getting exploited.</li>
<li>Find the vulnerabilities before someone else does it and exploit them.</li>
<li>How to fix those vulnerabilities?</li>
</ol>
<p>On the basis of severity level, vulnerabilities are categorized into 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low severity</li>
<li>Medium severity</li>
<li>High severity</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Classification-of-Vulnerabilities"><a href="#Classification-of-Vulnerabilities" class="headerlink" title="Classification of Vulnerabilities"></a><u>Classification of Vulnerabilities</u></h2><ul>
<li><b>Unpatched Servers</b></li>
<li><b>Operating System Flaws</b></li>
<li><b>Default Installation</b></li>
<li><b>Application Flaws</b></li>
<li><b>Default Passwords</b></li>
<li><b>Design Flaws</b></li>
<li><b>Open Services</b></li>
<li><b>Misconfiguration</b></li>
<li><b>Buffer Overflows</b></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-Unpatched-Servers"><a href="#1-Unpatched-Servers" class="headerlink" title="1. Unpatched Servers"></a><b><u>1. Unpatched Servers</u></b></h3><p>Server is just a computer where the organization’s data is stored centrally, also the websites are hosted on the servers only. Compromizing the server<br>means compromizing the data present in the server or the website that is being hosted on the server. If the server is not patched with the latest patches<br>then it will have the known vunerabilities in it. Patches are made availabele by the OS manufacturer to fix some past vulnerabilities, and when the patches<br>are launched then the vulnerabilities that are being patched are also known, which helps the attackers to exploit those vunerabilities easily.</p>
<h3 id="2-Operating-System-Flaws"><a href="#2-Operating-System-Flaws" class="headerlink" title="2. Operating System Flaws"></a><b><u>2. Operating System Flaws</u></b></h3><p>Vulnerabilities present in Operating System can lead to a risk to a device by the malwares, or some malcious codes/scripts that are run on the device. By this the attacker can get various information<br>stored in the device, ultimately leading to the data loss. Solution to this is to regularly patching the OS and also have antivirus installed on the device<br>of some good company.</p>
<h3 id="3-Default-Installation"><a href="#3-Default-Installation" class="headerlink" title="3. Default Installation"></a><b><u>3. Default Installation</u></b></h3><p>Default installation is different from default passwords. This refers to the default softwares/applcations that are installed in the device beforehand so that device can easily be used when it is booted first<br>time. For example: you get internet explorer installed on the Windows OS, so that you can at least get connected to the internet with it, rather you all download chrome browser with the help of explorer with it.<br>So if the attacker finds the vulnerabilty on such default installed applications, though he will not find much information on the target device by exploiting it but he might get the information related to<br>network or any other device to which he got connected. So you should change the settings of such applications before using them.</p>
<h3 id="4-Application-Flaws"><a href="#4-Application-Flaws" class="headerlink" title="4. Application Flaws"></a><b><u>4. Application Flaws</u></b></h3><p>Application flaws means the vulnerabilities that have occured due to improper validation schemes applied, or less coding capabilities of the developer. The attackers can use it for data tampering or data theft.<br>SQL injection attack is one such attack which is done by parameter tampering and using SQL commands in input fields. If proper validation of input data is applied to the application then the chances of such<br>exploits become very less.</p>
<h3 id="5-Default-Passwords"><a href="#5-Default-Passwords" class="headerlink" title="5. Default Passwords"></a><b><u>5. Default Passwords</u></b></h3><p>This is a common vulnerability, generally found in routers and IOT devices, where people don’t change the password of their device, and use it<br>without changing the password that was set by the company by default for that device. So attacker can easily find the default password from any search engine, and can use that password<br>to start using the device, and the device owner doesn’t even knows it that. Attacker can use the device in such malicious ways then.</p>
<h3 id="6-Design-Flaws"><a href="#6-Design-Flaws" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Flaws"></a><b><u>6. Design Flaws</u></b></h3><p>Vulnerabilities due to design flaws are present in all those application/softwares where the applaication is being used. For example the poor vaalidation techniques in input area, or incorrect encryption, or data structure.<br>Attacker can try to bypass the input validations any try to steal some confidential information.</p>
<h3 id="7-Open-Services"><a href="#7-Open-Services" class="headerlink" title="7. Open Services"></a><b><u>7. Open Services</u></b></h3><p>Open services refers to the ports that are open in the sevice, such as port 20,21 etc. If the service is not in use, then it is advisable to close the port<br>otherwise the service can be used by the attacker to exploit someway or the other and create a connection between the victim and attacker’s device. Network breeching can also happenif the ports are unnecessarily kept open.</p>
<h3 id="8-Misconfiguration"><a href="#8-Misconfiguration" class="headerlink" title="8. Misconfiguration"></a><b><u>8. Misconfiguration</u></b></h3><p>The root cause of many vulnerabilities is because of misconfigurations. For exampe, you have enabled the firewall but it is not properly configured, then it is of no use. Other misconfguration is, if you are running unnecessary services<br>on the device, banner grabbing is also possible by the attacker, because the website is hosted on the server with default settings.</p>
<h3 id="9-Buffer-Overflows"><a href="#9-Buffer-Overflows" class="headerlink" title="9. Buffer Overflows"></a><b><u>9. Buffer Overflows</u></b></h3><p>Another vulnerablity where the attacker can send random data to the victim’s device, by DOS attack, any the buffer or you can say the queue  of requests at the server side<br>becomes full and overflows, so it cannot handle more requests now. And therefore the victim’s device hangs and ultimately he has to take his device down from the network and restart it.</p>
<h2 id="What-can-Vulnerability-Scanners-do"><a href="#What-can-Vulnerability-Scanners-do" class="headerlink" title="What can Vulnerability Scanners do?"></a><u>What can Vulnerability Scanners do?</u></h2><p>Vulnerability scanners or vulnerability assessment tools can easily detect the known security weaknesses in a network or device and helps in securing the device<br>by showing the severity level of each vulnerability. Other goals of vulnerability scanners are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying the OS and its version running in the device</li>
<li>Detect ports in listening mode</li>
<li>Vulnerable applications installed</li>
<li>Accounts with weak passwords</li>
<li>Default services running</li>
<li>Misconfigurations with firewall<br></li>
</ol>

Active/Passive</u></h3><p>There is a control on timing and the degree of vulnerability scanning. Performs vulnerability checks on the network that consume resources on the network.<br>Passive scanners don’t affect system resources and perform data processing on separate analysis machine.</p>
<h3 id="6-Location-Data-examination"><a href="#6-Location-Data-examination" class="headerlink" title="6. Location/Data-examination"></a><u>6. Location/Data-examination</u></h3><p>These are further divided into network-based, agent-based, proxy and cluster scanners.</p>
<br>

<p>These are theorotical things, rest in real life you can perform the vulnerability assessment with the help of tools like nikto, nessus etc. They provide a detailed description of all the vulnerabilities present on the device. Enumeration and Vulnerability assessment are very much theorotical things, but are performed with 2-3 tools. Jo we just had a discussion on vulnerability assessment.</p>
<hr>
<p>In this blog I discussed about the vulnerability assessment. This was als an important topic to be discussed upon, so that you get an idea wha is vulnerabilty, how it is classified, how the tools are classified and so on. So in next blog I will discuss about system hacking, which is another interesting topic after scanning because it has less theory.</p>
