First apporach is to check the profiles and details about the file we get 


For this just simply use command 

` volatility imageinfo -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-0.png')

It shows us lot of profiles we can check one by one which is important for us and contains all process for this use command 

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-1.png')

It shows us that `Win7SP1x64` is important for us in this case.

we also get some important process in first go like ` paint cmd winrar dumpit `.

So start dumping the process one by one and check if they have some thing for us.

SO firstly I go for Dumpit and for dumping process you can simply use.

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 procdump -p <process-id> --dump-dir <directory> `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-2.png')

After I analyse the dump process ` DumpIt ` with strings on it and putting it in Hopper but I find nothing usefull there.

So know we go for our second process ` cmd `. For this you can use cmdscan to get results what is going on cmd that time.

command to use 

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 cmdscan `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-3.png')

we can see suspicious string on the ST4G3$1. 

Therefore I check the console to check cmd executes.

Command : 

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 console `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-4.png')

we find there base64 string under the cmd ST4G3$1

` echo ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0= | base64 -d `

We get our first flag of this level : ` flag{th1s_1s_th3_1st_st4g3!!} `

Lets check other process also if they have something in it.


So as we know we have winrar process runing so it have have files of rar type.

Command : 

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-5.png')

Therefore firstly checked the complete filescan so we get lot of reults. Now we have to find RAR file extension in it if there is so grep rar from result of filescan.

Command : 

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep rar `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-6.png')
so finally we got one file in documents of Alissa user. so we dump that file.

Command :

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 -Q 0x000000003fb48bc0 -D dumpit ` 

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-7.png')

so we got our rar file and when we try to unrar it it ask for password. But we can see a statement above it that says **Password is the password hash of Alissa ( Capital )**. So we can check the hashdump.

Command : 

` volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 hashdump `

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-8.png')

So we submit the hash value of the Alissa user and we get our another flag.

![info]('../assets/memlabs/mem-1-9.png')

So we go the flag for stage 3 so it means we miss one flag.
