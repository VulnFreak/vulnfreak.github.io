        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/Blockchain/banner3.jpg" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://www.tokens24.com/cryptopedia/basics/bitcoin-addresses-explained">here</a></caption><hr><p>In my last blog I had discussed about miners, why they do mining, what is unconfirmed transaction pool, saw different blocks and also how the block reward changes after the creation of some blocks. In this blog I am going to discuss about the concept of double spending, UTXOs, and the other concepts related to transaction in the blockchain.<br></p><h1 id="1-What-is-Double-Spending"><a href="#1-What-is-Double-Spending" class="headerlink" title="1.What is Double Spending?"></a>1.<u>What is Double Spending?</u></h1><p>When you have physical cash in your wallet and go to any store to buy grocery, clothes, any device etc. and after billing, the cashier gives you the total amount that you need to pay to buy that stuff. You give the whole payment in cash to the cashier and take away the stuff with you. But now is it possible that you pay the same cash, which you spent for the payment to buy stuffs, <strong>again for buying the coke,chips etc. from the store or from any other store?</strong> Yes, unless you steal the money from the cashier and trick him, but that’s the illegal and you will surely be punnished for doing this crime. So you cannot spend the same money to buy other things which you have already spent.<br></p><p>This is the scenario of double spending, where a person is using the same money to pay more than one parties. This problem in banking has to be resolved, otherwise the value of the money will decrease, and there would be no point of money, transactions, banking, account balance etc.<br></p><p>In cryptocurrency, since the money is digital, so it would be more easy for a person to duplicate the transaction and do double spending. But Satoshi Nakamoto thought about this problem during the creation of bitcoin, and resolved it by introducing the concept of <strong>verification and confirmation</strong> of transaction and adding <strong>timestamps</strong> to the transaction. In bitcoin consensus (agreement followed by each node in respective blockchain), the transaction should have at least 6 confirmations to gain the trust that it is genuine. Suppose you have 3 BTCs, and you spent 2.5 BTCs to two different wallet addresses (wallet address is same as account number of the benificiary), the transactions will go to the unconfirmed transaction pool, which I discussed in last blog. The miner wil confirm the first transaction, and since it is valid it will be added to the block, and now it just needs 6 confirmations to make this transaction happen. The second transaction which was still present in unconfirmed transaction pool, suppose the second miner takes out for confirmation, but it will be found that the transaction is invalid this time.<br></p><p>Why invalid this time? This is the main question. This is because every bitcoin when transferred from one bitcoin wallet (sender’s account) to other bitcoin wallet (receiver’s account), then the ownership of those certain bitcoins will change to the receiver’s wallet. <strong>Each cryptocurrency in blockchain is having a chain of ownership.</strong> So in the second time the transaction of the sender trying to double spend the same amount to second party got invalid because during the transaction verifiaction it was found that the owner of those BTCs was someone else.<br></p><p>The second case is, if both thetransactions are confirmed at the same time from the unconfirmed transaction pool, then in that case the two blocks will be formed in the blockchain. Yes, the blockchan splits for a while. So now the <strong>longest chain rule</strong> will apply, which says, among the two branches, the chain which will be the longest, i.e. the other blocks will keep on adding in blockchain, so they will also be added it one of the two branches. So one of the branch will be longer than other branch, and that longer branch will be permanent in the blockchain, and the shorter branch will be excluded. The branch should reach to the 6 blocks to become permanent. <strong>It is not possible that both the branches will have same size</strong>. The shorter branch is removed once the blockchain gets its permanent branch. The transactions of the removed branch again go to the unconfirmed pool of transactions or it depends on consensus what will happen.<br><br>In last blog I told that as soon as miner confirms the transaction and adds it to block, the transaction happens from the sender’s wallet to receiver’s wallet. Just because I wanted to introduce the concept to you. But the actual transaction happens when it get minimum 6 confirmations, i.e. after the block in which the transaction is added, there must be at least 6 blocks to have a successfull and genuine transaction. Why? I just discussed in above paragraphs. Also sometimes it depends on wallet, how much confirmation it needs to have a successfull transaction<br></p><p>The below snapshot shows the block numbers and their time of discovery in bitcoin blockchain. The block <strong>689462</strong> was found before the block <strong>689467</strong>. Hence the block <strong>689462</strong> has got the 6 confirmations, and since the block <strong>689467</strong> is the latest block, it has only one confirmation.<br></p><br><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/latestblocks.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><p>The below snapshot shows the block <strong>689462</strong> which has got 6 confirmations, and is more trustworthy than <strong>689467</strong>.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/success.png" alt="hack"></p><br><p>The below snapshot shows the block <strong>689467</strong>. So it is not trustful, once it gets 6 more block added, the transactions of the block will be confirmed. It totally depends on wallets, some wallets need 3 confirmations, some needs 2 confirmations, and the transactions of large amounts sometimes need 15 confirmations also.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/unconfirmed.png" alt="hack"></p><h1 id="2-What-is-UTXO"><a href="#2-What-is-UTXO" class="headerlink" title="2.What is UTXO?"></a>2.<u>What is UTXO?</u></h1><p>UTXO is Unspent Transaction Output, a basic element of a blockchain. Suppose you go to the supermarket to buy some snacks. You will have some money in your physical wallet. You did a shopping of 30$. The cashier at the billing counter asks you for payment. You took out the wallet and see that you have one 50$ note. You gave that 50$ note to cashier and in return the cashier gives you the 20$ change which you keep in wallet. Fine? The total money you gave was 50$, in return you got 20$, so it can be interpreted as an equation 50$=30$+20$. 50$ you spent from your wallet, which lead to the creation of two hard cash, 30$ and 20$. LHS=RHS, the total amount created on left hand side is equal to total money created on right hand side. We can also say that 20$ were unspent. Why unspent? because you can still spend this 20$ from your wallet to buy other things, but the 30$ are spent, you cannot use them again. ALso the 50$ was your input for the transaction from your wallet, which resulted to 30$ and 20$ as output, from which you got 20$ back as another input to your wallet.<br><br>Similarly in the cryptocurrency, when a transaction is done, the change you receive in return is known as <strong>Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)</strong>. When you create a transaction in bitcoin, then suppose you have 0.6 BTC, 0.5 BTC,1.8 BTC, 1.5 BTC in your wallet(I have simplified the values of BTCs, in actual after decimal there are 8 digits). Yeah your wallet looks like this in backend, the bicoins from various transactions are not combined until you explicitly do it, because each of them has there own chain of owners. Your wallet hides this and displays the total to you. Now suppose you want to create the transaction of 2 BTCs, your wallet in the backend will automatically choose those <strong>“UTXOs”</strong> which will result to slightly more than the 2 BTCs, because transaction fees also has to be paid (all this is automatic, you just add the amount you want to pay and receiver’s wallet address). So, the wallet suppose takes 1.8 BTC and 0.5 BTC for transaction, which amounts to 2.3 BTC. It will go to the unconfirmed transaction pool from which it will be added to block, the transaction fee will be given to miner and transaction will take 6 confirmations to be successfull. 2 BTCs had reached to receiver, suppose miner’s fee was 0.1 BTC, so it will be paid to him automatically, now we are left with 0.2 BTC as change. If you claim then it will be reverted to your wallet, otherwise it is paid to miner. You don’t need to explicitly claim because the wallet at the backend does it, these 0.2 BTCs are UTXO, which are reverted to your account, which you can use in future. Now your wallet will look like 0.6 BTC, 0.2 BTC, 1.5 BTC.<br><br><br>The snapshot below shows a transaction from the sender in the left of arrow to the receivers’ (receivers are marked with red boundary) addresses.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/tx.png" alt="hack"></p><br><p>In above snapshot the transaction of <strong>2.37361032 BTC</strong> is initiated by the sender on LHS. The transaction is splitted to 5 outputs, out of which the green boundaries addresses are the UTXO, which are reverted back to account, and the red boundaries are the actual spent, which the receiver will receive. Now have a look on blue boundary, in LHS and RHS, you will see that the actual input is equal to the output. This concept I already discussed above, to keep track that the BTCs are not lost, LHS should be equal to RHS.<br><br><br></p><h1 id="3-Will-the-Bitcoin-Addresses-Finish"><a href="#3-Will-the-Bitcoin-Addresses-Finish" class="headerlink" title="3.Will the Bitcoin Addresses Finish?"></a>3.<u>Will the Bitcoin Addresses Finish?</u></h1><p>Every time you do a transaction, a new wallet address of the sender as well as the receiver will get generated, this is done to provide the anonimity to the parties, and no one could track the transactions. You can still track but it will take a lot of time in mapping. So you will see that your wallet address changes every time you do a transaction, so this is the reason why it happens. In above transaction also you will see the wallet address of UTXO is not same, 1 is same and other one is different, but both are the addresses of the sender. So that’s why the two UTXO have different address but ultimately going to sender. This does not means that you will not be able to use other bitcoins which you had in your wallet, because ultimately the owner of those addresses are you only. So, you have a lot of addresses in the backend but the wallet hides the complexity and shows you the recent address. Even if someone will send the bitcoin to older address, you will receive them, because you are only the owner.<br><br>This arises these questions <strong>Will the bitcoin addresses come to end soon? What if I get an address and that address is already taken? What if someone counters the same wallet address that I have and access the same coins?</strong> Let’s see some mathematical part of the bitcoin block chain.<br><br></p><ul><li>Each wallet address has a private key. So you generate new private keys everytime after the transaction. These are mapped in the backend of your wallet. Therefore having a new wallet address that hets generated after a transaction, and we discussed why is it done in above section.</li><li>Each private key is of 256 bits.</li><br><ul type="square"><li>Therefore having <b>2<sup>256</sup></b> combinations.</li><br><li>This means you can flip a coin 256 times to get completely random private key.

      <title>Understanding The Concepts Of Blockchain</title>
      <link href="/2021-06-25-BlockchainPart2/"/>
      <url>/2021-06-25-BlockchainPart2/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/Blockchain/banner2.jpg" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://www.finance-monthly.com/2019/08/the-top-3-cryptocurrencies-what-makes-them-a-success/">here</a></caption><hr><p>In my last blog I had discussed the idea of cryptography and the use of encryption, the concept of blockchain, a field which has derived from the concept of cryptography. Analogy of normal bank transaction and the bitcoin transaction, how it is different and why is it proposed to use a decentralized cryptocurrency instead of a centralized banking system.<br><br>In this blog I am going to discuss other concepts of bitcoin blockchain. One important thing is, bitcoin blockchain is totally different from ethereum blockchain. Though the concept used is of blockchain but the implementation of transaction and verificaiton of that transaction is different. So firstly I will finish the discussion on bitcoin blockchain in this and upcoming blogs, then I will discuss the ethereum blockchain.<br></p><h1 id="1-How-Blockchain-Is-Transparent"><a href="#1-How-Blockchain-Is-Transparent" class="headerlink" title="1.How Blockchain Is Transparent"></a>1.<u>How Blockchain Is Transparent</u></h1><p>In blockchain everything which is being stored in the form of cryptographic methods. Cryptography involves hashing and encryption. These two terms are different from each other. Hashing is one way crytography and encryption involves both encryption and decryption. Blockchain uses asymytric type of encrption which involves two different keys, public and private key. All this is used to digitally prove your identity by digitally signing the transaction. That’s why it is transparent. You can easily see all the transactions that are being validated in the blockchain explorer <a href="https://blockchain.com/explorer">here</a>. In future explanation I will be using this website to elaborate various examples, because you will be able to see each and everything happening in real time there.<br><br></p><h1 id="2-What-Is-Unconfirmed-Transaction-Pool"><a href="#2-What-Is-Unconfirmed-Transaction-Pool" class="headerlink" title="2.What Is Unconfirmed Transaction Pool?"></a>2.<u>What Is Unconfirmed Transaction Pool?</u></h1><p>In cryptocurrencies, when a sender sends the money to some merchant/recepient then the transaction takes some time to be confirmed before the currency is transeferred from sender’s wallet to merchant’s wallet. The confirmation is done by the miner on the grounds that the sender is having desired funds or not. By the time the transaction is not confirmed, the transaction is stored in a space known as <strong>unconfirmed transaction pool</strong>. So, the Bitcoin will have its own unconfirmed transaction pool, Ethereum will have its own unconfirmed transaction pool, Dogecoin will have its own unconfirmed transaction pool and so on.<br><br>In this pool, all the transctions that are not conirmed and have to be confirmed by the miner are present. It may be 1 transaction, 10 transaction, 100 transactions or any number of transactions that are not yet confirmed by the miner. The miner basically selects those sets of transaction which provides him more <strong>fee reward(I will discuss in future)</strong>. So it totally depends on miner, your transaction will be completed once it is confirmed by miner, which means that till the time the sender’s amount is in unconfirmed transaction pool the sender is only the owner of that amount, but once it gets confirmed the receiver becomes the owner of that amount. The time in confirmation of transaction can take 10 mins, 20 mins, 1 hour, 2hours, 12 hours, a week or more. Till the time miner don’t confirms the transaction, the money is not transferred. <strong>BUT</strong> there is a time limit within which it has to be confirmed, after this if still the transaction is not confirmed then the transaction is removed from the unconfirmed pool and money is not transferred from your wallet. This limited time is of 14 days, within which your transaction has to get confirmed, otherwise your amount is added again in your wallet.<br><br></p><h1 id="3-Who-Is-Miner"><a href="#3-Who-Is-Miner" class="headerlink" title="3.Who Is Miner?"></a>3.<u>Who Is Miner?</u></h1><p>I have used a word <strong>miner</strong> in above paragraph. What does it mean? Is it a person or a machine? such questions arise at initial stage when learning about blockchain. A miner is a person who is responsible for confirming the transactions present in the unconfirmed transaction pool. He/she creates the block, and by saying “creates” it means that miner finds the hash of the block. All the transactions that are confirmed by the miner are added by his/her block. In bitcoin the size of the bolock is 1 Mb, and it is fixed for all the blocks which are the part of bitcoin blockchain. The size is mentioned in the consensus of bitcoin blockchain, if you want to increse the size of block then it can only be done through consensus. The consensus is just like a pact that every node in the blockchain have to agree. So bitcoin has its own consensus, eterum has its own consensus. In this way the hash, which is unique to every block is found by the hacker and add the transactions to it.</p><p><br><br></p><h1 id="4-What-Miners-Get-In-Return"><a href="#4-What-Miners-Get-In-Return" class="headerlink" title="4.What Miners Get In Return?"></a>4.<u>What Miners Get In Return?</u></h1><p>It is an obvious question because miners are using there computer resources to validate the transactions and add them to the block. But why are they doing so? They are doing it to get the reward that every miner is getting to solve the puzzle(I will discuss in upcoming blog) and get the hash of the block. Currently the miner is getting 6.25 BTC(<strong>block reward</strong>) as a reward when he/she solves the puzzle to get the hash of the block. Also the miner gets the <strong>fee reward</strong> which is paid by the sender in order to make the transaction.<br><br><strong>Block reward</strong> is changed after every 210,000 blocks, i.e. approx 4 years and remain constant throughout the period, whereas the <strong>fee reward</strong> depends on the amount of transaction that the sender is sending to merchant. Satoshi Nakamoto who created the Bitcoin blockchain created the first block of this blockchain, and at that time the Block reward was of 50 BTC. Refer below snapshot, which is the <strong>Block 0</strong>.<br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The first block is <strong>block 0</strong> therefore the second block is <strong>block 1</strong>, hence the 210000th block is <strong>block 209999</strong>, and after 210000 block we know what happens. If not then read the above content again.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/block0.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><br><p>Right after this see the <strong>Block 209999</strong> in the below snapshot and see the block reward.</p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/block209999.png" alt="hack"></p><br><br><p>Now see the <strong>Block 210000</strong> in the below snapshot and see the block reward, it should be halved as it is the 210001th block.</p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/block210000.png" alt="hack"></p><br><br><p>Now see the <strong>Block 420000</strong> in the below snapshot and see the block reward.</p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/block420000.png" alt="hack"></p><br><br><p>Similarly find the block from where th block reward started to be 6.25 BTCs. Now suppose you have 4 BTC in bitcoin wallet, and you want to send 4BTCs to a merchant, you will unable to make the payment because the “fee” that you need to pay has also have to be paid by you. Now suppose the fee for this transaction is 0.00090000 BTC, so you have to send 4.00090000 BTC, out of which 4 BTCs will automatically be transferred to the merchant and 0.00090000 BTC to the miner as a fee reward once the transaction is confirmed. But since we don’t have 4.00090000 BTCs in wallet, the transaction cannot be initiated. You don’t need to worry to calculate the extra fee that you need to pay during the transaction. The wallet automatically calculates the fee and adds to the total amount that you are paying to the merchant. Without fee you cannot make the transaction.<br><br>We saw in above example that the transaction was unsuccessfull because we were not able to pay the fee. But now suppose instead of 4 BTC I want to make transaction of 2 BTCs. Now suppose the fee for the transaction is <strong>0.000XXXXX</strong> BTCs, where <strong>X</strong> is any number from the wallet that we have to pay as a fee for the transaction. Now the transaction will be initiated for 2.000XXXXX BTCs, and since I have sufficient funds(I have 4 BTCs in wallet), I can initiate the transaction, which will go to unconfirmed transaction pool, and if the miner confirms it then the merchant will receive the money. Below is the snapshot of transactions of <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/0000000000000000000a2b3818afc6aa08a2490a693eff4e93c027163c6d5cec"><b>Block 688767</b></a> of Bitcoin, showng the fee receipt of every transaction that the sender had to send along with the money requested by merchant.<br><br></p><p><img src="/assets/Blockchain/fee.png" alt="hack"></p><br><br><p>In this blog I have discussed the concepts on why transaparancy is there in cryptocurrencies, what’s unconfirmed transaction pool, we saw various blocks, their block reward, how does block reward gets affected, who are miners etc. I hope you got it. Now in next blog I am going to discuss the other interesting concepts of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/Blockchain/banner1.jpg" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20210430/c1_2108411_210430122446.jpg">here</a></caption><hr><p>Till now I have various concepts of ethical hacking such as <strong>how to start with it</strong>, different steps in ethical hacking like <strong>footprinting, scanning, enumeration, breaking passwords, clearing logs</strong> ; also I have discussed the attacks like <strong>how hackers hack your android or pc or how they do MITM or DOS attack</strong> and have also discussed various concepts of <strong>Cyber Forensics</strong> in last blogs.  <br><br>But now since we have got the idea of cryptography and the use of encryption, we should start with the concept of blockchain, a field which has derived from the concept of cryptography. It is not at all difficult as it looks like. You should be familiar with the concept of cryptography.<br><br></p><h1 id="1-Why-Blockchain"><a href="#1-Why-Blockchain" class="headerlink" title="1.Why Blockchain?"></a>1.<u>Why Blockchain?</u></h1><p>This whole concept was discovered by a person named <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, which he implemented in <strong>Bitcoin</strong>. In the present world(without blockchain) evrything is centralized. With the term <strong>centralized</strong>, I mean that the data is stored in one place, there is one body governing it which has some people who have the rights to access the database of banking transactions. Every time you make a transaction, the process will involve that central body where the money in front of your name/account number. Let’s see this visually:<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> __________                          ____________                          _______________________________________                                                 </span><br><span class="line">|          |                        |            |    Request goes to     | Names     | Old Balance | New Balance |                                  </span><br><span class="line">| You want |     You open the       | You make a |    web server to do    |           |             |             |                       </span><br><span class="line">| to send  |  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;    | payment of |  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;  | Ramesh    |   80$+20$   |    100$     |                                         </span><br><span class="line">|  20$ to  |    bank&#39;s website      |   20$ to   |    changes in both     | Nitin     |     60$     |     60$     |                                     </span><br><span class="line">|  Ramesh  |                        |   Ramesh   |       accounts         | Your name |   20$-20$   |     0$      |                                        </span><br><span class="line">|__________|                        |____________|                        |___________|_____________|_____________|  </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Your Motive                        Your Transaction                      Processing in database at centralized server                    </span><br><span class="line"></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br><p>The database will get updated, which means the transaction is successfull. <strong>If</strong> the transaction was unsuccessfull due to some technical error, then that centralized body will be responsible to roll back to the old state. Or you can file a complain against the company who is providing the banking service. You are not responsible for the technical error that occured because there is a central body who is having the control on the service. It is the responsibility of the cenral body to provide the best services, to keep the data safe and to have a secured communicaton.<br><br>But this is not the case in <strong>Blockchain</strong>. Blockchain is not controlled by any central body, infact there is no concept of centralized server. The nodes/computers which are the part of blockchain are itself the server, i.e. they have the information of all the customers who are using the service, stored in their devices in the form of ledger. Ledger is simply the database in blockchain. All the information related to the customer using the respective blockchain service is stored in a ledger, and the ledger is stored in all the nodes/computers that are the part of that blockchain service.<br><br>So the difference is, the data that was being stored in a particular server, was now being distributed to all the nodes/computers that are the part of blockchain network. <strong>The centralized data has shifted to decentralized data.</strong> Let’s discuss the concept of blockchain in terms of banking sector. The <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> are the new currencies in blockcain network. Such as <strong>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin etc.</strong><br><br>Now you would have a question that, in banking system, the companies providing the service first verify and validate whether the person doing a transaction is a genuine or not, how it is done in blockchain? The answer is simple, all the nodes that take part in blockchain, do the verification process, so that the person doing the transation is genuine and has sufficient balance for transaction. Every node don’t have the sufficient hardware rsources to verify the transaction and create a block(this will be discussed later), so the nodes that can do this easily are called <strong>MINERS</strong>.<br><br><br></p><h1 id="2-What-Is-Blockchain"><a href="#2-What-Is-Blockchain" class="headerlink" title="2.What Is Blockchain?"></a>2.<u>What Is Blockchain?</u></h1><p>As the name suggests, <strong>A chain of blocks</strong>. Similar to the concept of linked list data structure, where one node contains the address of second node and second node contains the address of third node, in the same way in blockchain, one block contains the address of another block, as well as the same block contains the address of previous block. It is not actually the address, you will find what is it in upcoming blogs of blockchain. The block as a whole contains the transactons that a person has done, it might be a single transaction or it might be 10,20,50,1000,20000….. transactions. The average size of block is 1MB and can grow upto 8MB. Every block in the blockchain has a block number and a hash of all the data that is stored in the block, including the transactions and the header.<br><br></p><h2 id="2-1How-Is-Blockchain-Benificial"><a href="#2-1How-Is-Blockchain-Benificial" class="headerlink" title="2.1How Is Blockchain Benificial"></a>2.1<u>How Is Blockchain Benificial</u></h2><p>The blockchain is in boost nowadays, and the blockchain can be of anything till the time it is decentralized. The blockchain of Bitcoin and blockchain of Ethereum are totally differet and so is with Dogecoin, though they use the same concept of blockchain. The nodes that partcipate in the blockchain of Bitcoin cannot access the ledgers of the Ethereum. It is another thing if you are a part of both the blockchains because you have a great hardware installation. The characteristics due to which it is in great demand are:</p><ol><li><b><u>Immutability</u>:</b> The data ones entered in a block cannot be changed/altered/modified again.</li><li><b><u>Decentralized</u>:</b> It has no governing body, therefore no high charges to be withdrwn from people as a service charge. Infact the nodes maintain the whole network.</li><li><b><u>Secured</u>:</b> Each data in the blockchain is encrypted and due to the <b>immutability</b> characteristiic no one can change the data.</li><li><b><u>Transparancy</u>:</b> Everything is public in blockchain, if something malicious happens then everyone gets know the modified data, which is then restored with the help of copy of ledger of some other node.</li><li><b><u>Consensus</u>:</b> It is a protocol that all nodes have to fllow in a network, related to decision making in a scenario.</li><li><b><u>Fatster Settlements</u>:</b> In centralized scenario if something goes wrong in transaction then it takes lot of days to decide where the actual transaction is. But this is not there in blockchain, ones you made the transaction it will be received by other party.</li></ol><br><br><p>I discussed the concept of blockchain in this blog, yeah it’s not completed. There are many other concepts also that have to be discusse. I will be discussing them in upcoming blogs. This blog was just an introduction to the blockchain, surely there is lot more ahead.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Forensics with FTK Imager Part 2</title>
      <link href="/2021-06-09-Forensics_with_FTK_Image_%20part_2/"/>
      <url>/2021-06-09-Forensics_with_FTK_Image_%20part_2/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2banner.jpg" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://drivesaversdatarecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/df-process2.jpg.webp">here</a></caption><hr><p>In my last blog I discussed the interface of FTK Imager tool and talked about various files of NTFS, a widely used tool in terms of Cyber Forensics, and also why I<br>like this tool is because it has so many features and yet it is a free tool. If you don’t have FTK Imager tool then you can download it<br>from this <a href="https://marketing.accessdata.com/l/46432/2020-09-24/8l45td">link</a>. <br><br></p><p>In this blog I am going to show how the files are indexed in <strong>MFT</strong> file. The various important offset numbers in <strong>$MFT</strong> file. Also I will show how we can combine the fragments of the file(any file mp4,mp3,.exe,.apk,.txp,.ppt etc…) and combine them to form the source file again.<br></p><h1 id="1-Various-offset-in-MFT-file"><a href="#1-Various-offset-in-MFT-file" class="headerlink" title="1.Various offset in $MFT file"></a>1.<u>Various offset in $MFT file</u></h1><br><p><strong>What is offset?</strong><br>Offset is just a position of the hexadecimal values in FTK Imager. Let’s see an example:</p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_1.PNG" alt="hack"></p><p>The ablove snapshot is the snapshot of 1st sector of the MFT file, which is of 512 bytes. The size of the sector is always 512 bytes. The size of the cluster changes, according to what you have chosen at the time of formatting the disk(min size of a cluster is 4096 bytes, also known as allocation unit size). That we have discussed in last blog. Above snap is the <strong>$MFT</strong> file’s 1st sector, and it will be same in everyone’s disk which is having NTFS file system.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The $MFT file is the index file, which stores the information regarding all the files and folders in the respective volume whose $MFT file it is. And the indexing is done in the form of records. Every file of that volume is having a record in $MFT file and these records are of 1024 bytes which are sequentially stored in the sectors of the volume. Remember that this $MFT is a file, stored sequentially and not broken into fragments unlike other files. Occupies all the clusters and doesn’t leave any RAM slack. 1024 bytes (2 sectors) are used to store the records as a security for if the size of file present in record increases in future then the record could be extended. <br><br><br><strong>Now your question would be if the file is of 2GB then how its record would fit in 1024 bytes?</strong><br><br>The answer is simple, the record of the files are stored in hexadecimal form, which sotres the address of the cluster where that particular file is stored. So if in case that 2GB file is fragmented into 4 parts, and those 4 fragments are stored in different clusters, then the record will store the address of those 4 clusters in hexadecimal format. All this I will show practically in this blog.<br><br><br><br></p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_1.PNG" alt="hack"><br><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_2.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br></p><p>The above two snapshots show the 1024 bytes(means 2 sectors) record of the $MFT file. In $MFT file the first record is always of $MFT file. The second sector is empty bcz the there are not many files in my logical volume to have more data in the records of $MFT. But yes the record will increase to another sector if I add more files in the volume that it is unable to map within 512 bytes.<br><br><br><br></p><h1 id="2-Let’s-see-the-record-of-another-file-in-the-volume"><a href="#2-Let’s-see-the-record-of-another-file-in-the-volume" class="headerlink" title="2.Let’s see the record of another file in the volume"></a>2.<u>Let’s see the record of another file in the volume</u></h1><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_3.PNG" alt="hack"><br><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_4.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br></p><p>The above two snapshots are showing the record of one of the tools of from Microsoft <strong>pslist.exe</strong>. If I search for this name in FTK imager like shown below:<br><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_5.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br></p><p>Then there might be more than one entries, depending if this file is present in any folder or not. If the file is in folder, then definitely when you search, you will find one of the entries in the folder, because the folder is also indexed in $MFT file. So, the same name could be present in that record. But we are finding the record for this file, so make sure that at the beginning of the record of this file, there is <strong>File0</strong> in the beginning. As you can see in the snapshot below:<br><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_6.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br><br><br></p><p>Now let’s see the various offsets(the position), their hexadecimal values(what hexadecimal value is present at that position) and what does it means with respect to record:</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Offset number always starts with 0 in a record and therefore goes till 511 in a sector. Also the Hexadecimal values might be changed in you device, so take the reference from the example I am using only for this blog and use it accordingly in your device. Also one more thing that the word <strong>Attribute</strong> will be used much in below table, which means that the information regarding the file is stored in various sections of record. Each section shows different information regarding the file. And these sections is known as <strong>Attributes</strong>.<br></p><h2 id="Record-begins"><a href="#Record-begins" class="headerlink" title="Record begins"></a>Record begins</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Sno.</th><th>Offset</th><th>Hexadecimal Value (0x)</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>4-5</td><td>30 00</td><td><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_7.PNG" alt="hack"></td><td>This means that at offset 48 (value of signed integer) the details regarding the error handling is stored</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>38</td><td><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2_8.PNG" alt="hack"></td><td>This means that the length of the first attribute is 55 offsets.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/CyberForensics/bannerftk.jpg" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://147146-880759-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/computer-forensics-classes-in-dubai.jpg">here</a></caption><hr><p>In this blog I am going to show the interface of FTK Imager tool and talk about various files of NTFS, a widely used tool in terms of Cyber Forensics, and also why I<br>like this tool is because it has so many features and yet it is a free tool. If you don’t have FTK Imager tool then you can download it<br>from this <a href="https://marketing.accessdata.com/l/46432/2020-09-24/8l45td">link</a>. </p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftkhome.png" alt="hack"><br><br></p><p>This is the home screen of ftk imager. In this you can do the following:</p><ol><li>Add evidence item</li><li>Create image of RAM</li><li>Create image of DISK</li><li>Various options of image available</li><li>Read an evidence item cluster by cluster</li><li>Search for suspecious keyword in evidence item</li></ol><p>and the list goes on and on. That’s why it is a vast and helpful tool in forensics.<br></p><h1 id="1-Various-files-present-in-NTFS"><a href="#1-Various-files-present-in-NTFS" class="headerlink" title="1.Various files present in NTFS"></a>1.<u>Various files present in NTFS</u></h1><p>New Technology File System(NTFS) is a widely used file system in Windows operating system. This file system has some default files which it<br>creates for itself to keep a track of all the files in a disk, just like an index keeps all the track of all the pages of a book. Before moving<br>forward let me tell you basic architecture of a disk.</p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/disk.jpg" alt="hack"></p><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://www.slashcam.de/images/news/g600/HDD-schema-14071_PIC2-600.jpg">here</a></caption><br><p>The cluster is a smallest part of a disk of fixed size(512 bytes always) and a cluster is a group of sectors. Generally when you format a disk, you get an option<br>to choose the size of a cluster.<br></p><h3 id="1-1Why-is-it-asked"><a href="#1-1Why-is-it-asked" class="headerlink" title="1.1Why is it asked?"></a>1.1<u>Why is it asked?</u></h3><p>It is a good practice to keep the size of a cluster as small as you can, mostly recommended as <strong>4096 bytes</strong>. It is so because sometimes when you create<br>a file for example a text file as <em>test.txt</em>. Most of the times the text file are not so big, or even if they are big then their size wouldn’t be the<br>multiple of the size of cluster(be it 4090 bytes in our case). Say the size of the cluster is 8192 bytes. The size of the file is less than the size of a cluster, the remaining 4102 bytes will be wasted of the cluster(<em>not exactly wasted but it will come in use untill the disk is almost full</em>). This free space is known as <strong>slack space</strong>. Some of the criminals take the advantage of this slack space to store some hidden data in the disk.<br><br><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Note the following things in above example:<br></p><ol><li>Size of sector is 512 bytes(always fixed) </li><li>Size of 1 cluster is 8192 bytes i.e. 16 sectors</li><li>Size of file is 4090 bytes (Or 7 sectors and 506 bytes) </li><li>Actual number of sectors used by file is 8 (7 fully and 8th partially)</li><li>Slack space calculated for above file will be 8192-4090=&gt;4102 bytes.</li><li>The salck space of 4102 bytes is divided into two parts: <strong>RAM Slack</strong> and <strong>File Slack</strong>.</li><li>RAM slack is the number of bytes left in the sector. In this example the 512-506=&gt;6 bytes is the RAM Slack. Why 512? Because the size of 1 sector is 512 bytes and the file is stored in only 7 sectors fully and 506 bytes of 8th sector. So the space which is left in 8th sector i.e. 512-506=&gt;6 bytes is the RAM Slack.</li><li>We now know the RAM slack as 6 bytes. Therefore 4102-6=&gt;4096 bytes is the File Slack, i.e 8 sectors. 8 sectors are wasted because of choosing 8192 bytes cluster. If we would have chosen 4096 bytes clusters then <strong>this wastage would have reduced to only 6 bytes RAM slack, and no File Slack would be there at that time</strong>.</li><li>RAM Slack is used by RAM as a dump.</li></ol><br><p>I hope you have got from the example used above what is a sector, cluster, slack space and why it is necessary to choose small cluster size!!</p><br><p>Now one more thing, just an extra knowledge, that if the cluster size is more, then the fragments will be less which would enhance the reading and writing speed and also be feasible in indexing.</p><br><br><p>Remember in the last paragraph I wrote a statement <strong>not exactly wasted but it will come in use untill the disk is almost full</strong>. So how is this thing possible<br>in NTFS file system? we have various hidden files(note that this hidden file is not same as hidden file you create). These hidden files are created by default<br>as soon as the disk is formatted with the NTFS file system, and the name of these files start with <strong>$</strong>.<br><br></p><h1 id="2-How-to-see-these-files"><a href="#2-How-to-see-these-files" class="headerlink" title="2.How to see these files?"></a>2.<u>How to see these files?</u></h1><p>Follow the steps to see these files:</p><ol><li>Go to <b>File > Add Evidence Item</b> <br><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk1.PNG"></li><li>Select <b>Logical Drive</b> <br><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftk2.PNG"></li><li>Select <b>Logical Drive > Next</b></li><li>Select your volume, be it C, D, E or any other</li><li>Click on <b>Finish</b></li></ol><br><p>The evidence i.e. the logical disk C in my case is added to the <strong>Evidence Tree</strong> panel of the window, and the window will look like the below snap:</p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/ftkevidence.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><p>Click on + button to expand the tree to get root folder as shown in below snapshot:</p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/tree.PNG" alt="hack"></p><p>Click on <strong>root</strong> folder directory, and see the changes in <strong>File List</strong> pane of the window. Scroll down to see the files of NTFS file system, responsible to<br>maintain the records regarding the files directories, deleted fies, boot file, even the swap space file can also be seen, the ones marked with <strong>$</strong> symbol in the beginning. These files are the first files to be loaded in the beginning of the disk to map each and everything in the disk. The below snapshot shows such files:</p><p><img src="/assets/CyberForensics/NTFSfiles.PNG" alt="hack"></p><table><thead><tr><th>File Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>$AttrDef</strong></td><td>The file contains information related to the usable space in a volume</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$BadClus</strong></td><td>Contains information about bad clusters in a disk. You might have seen the notification when you plug in the USB drive about “Scan disk to repair bad clustes”. The PC gets to know about bad clusters from this file only.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$Bitmap</strong></td><td>It stores the flag relatd to the cluster if it is free or not.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$Boot</strong></td><td>As the name suggests, this file contains the necessary information related to the device booting. So that’s why it’s present in the first cluster. Also have the addresses of $MFT and $MFTMirr.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$LogFile</strong></td><td>File contains information about all the changes you do in the file system.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$MFT</strong></td><td>Short form of <strong>Master File Table</strong>. The index of NTFS, having information of all the files that are present in the volume. Each volume has its own MFT, which is mapped to all the files in the volume with the location of cluster, starting point of the file, checksums etc. All this will be discussed in necxt blog.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$MFTMirr</strong></td><td>Mirror file of $MFT first 4 records, like a backup of $MFT, $MFTMirr, $LogFile and $Volume.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$Secure</strong></td><td>Each file has its own ACL in the file system, be it any mp4 file, mp3 file, image file, txt file or anything. The identical ACLs of the files are stored in this $Secure file to reduce the overhead.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$UpCase</strong></td><td>It’s always of 128 KB in size. Having the uppercase letters. Basic purpose of this file is to sort the files according to filenames.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>$Volume</strong></td><td>Contains information related to the volume.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These are the common NTFS files that get loaded first in the clusters to bring in the functionality of file system and maintain the record of each file that gets stored here.<br></p><p>Why I discussed this? Because this will come handy in the discussion of next blog where I will show how we can stude the <strong>$MFT</strong> file and access the files from there, even we can restore the deleted file from there.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/responderbanner.PNG" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://blog.ipleaders.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ways-Websites-Are-Hacked-How-to-Prevent-Them-1-696x333.png">here</a></caption><hr><p>In this blog I am going to show an another attack which is very prominent in the Local Area Network. This attack is called <strong>NBTNS-LLMNR Poisoning</strong>. As we know that NBTNS i.e. the netbios name service and the link-local multicast name resolution are the two services which help in the file transfer among the Windows OS in a local network. I will show how this can be done and what can be done to mitigate it.</p><h1 id="What-This-Service-Actually-Does"><a href="#What-This-Service-Actually-Does" class="headerlink" title="What This Service Actually Does?"></a><u>What This Service Actually Does?</u></h1><p>The two services NBTNS and LLMNR help in the name resolution of the devices connected in a network in order to transfer the files. We do have seen the shared folders in our Windows OS somewhere. So these shared folder are accessible from other Windows OS as well, but to access that, the nbtns service runs to create a connection with other host. Just like DNS does, the same task is done by NBTNS and LLMNR but for the local level to know the host and connect it.</p><h1 id="What-is-NBTNS-LLMNR-Poisoning"><a href="#What-is-NBTNS-LLMNR-Poisoning" class="headerlink" title="What is NBTNS-LLMNR Poisoning?"></a><u>What is NBTNS-LLMNR Poisoning?</u></h1><p>The attcker gets connected to the network to listen the broadcast packets from nbtns and llmnr service and respond it. Let’s see the case.<br><br><br><br></p><ol><li>A local network is there where the shared resources such as printers along with some computers. Each device has its own device name. And the local DNS of LAN has the entries of the device names mapped with respective IP addresses.<br></li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Now some device wants to print the document, so it will we typing the name of device or IP to connect it and use the printer.<br></li></ol><ol start="3"><li>When the name of device is entered it is sent to DNS, if it is present there then redirected to the correct device, if entry is not present then the request is broadcasted to know which device name is it.<br></li></ol><ol start="4"><li>The attacker gets the request and responds it by saying that “yes it is me”. Ultimately the victim machine gets to know that the device is up and now it sends its username and hashes to the attacker unknown from the fact that it is an attacker.<br></li></ol><ol start="5"><li>This is the whole concept og poisoning and how does the attacker gets the hashes.<br><br><br></li></ol><h1 id="How-It-Can-Be-Done"><a href="#How-It-Can-Be-Done" class="headerlink" title="How It Can Be Done?"></a><u>How It Can Be Done?</u></h1><p>The attack is done in a Local Area Network. Where the attacker has to respond the request generated by the devices connected there. Following are the steps that can be performed to do so:<br><br></p><ol><li> You need one Windows OS device.</li><br><li> Kali being the attacker machine. Make sure they are in bridged connection.<br><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/responder1.PNG"></li><br><br><li> Open terminal and start <b>Responder</b> by entering <b>responder -I [Network Interface Name like eth0]</b>.<br><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/responder2.PNG"><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/responder3.PNG"></li><br><br><li> The responder will start at the specified interface.</li><br><li> In Windows OS, use the <i>hotkey</i>  <b>windows+R</b>.</li><br><li> The Run dialogue box will be prompted.</li><br><li> Now type there <b>\\[any IP ID]</b> OR <b>\\[any string]</b> and press enter key.<br><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/responder4.PNG"></li><br><br><li> As soon as it is done, the local DNS will get the request to connect to the string name or the IP address, but it will unable to redirect because the intry is not present in DNS, so it will be broadcasted, to know wihich IP or device name is it.</li><br><li>  The responder running in the kali machine will respond now, and now the hashes of the user and the device name will be captured by the responder.<br><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/responder5.PNG"></li><br><br><li>  Now you can crack the hashes with <b>John the ripper</b> as I have shown in <a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/PasswordCrack/">https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/PasswordCrack</a> blog. </li><br><li>  You can also find the hashes in the <i>/usr/share/responder/logs/[IP address.txt]</i> file that you got above.</li></ol><br><br><p><em>In this way the NBTNS-LLMNR Poisoning attack takes place in a Local Area Network. You can easily get the victim’s device name, IP address, username, password hash from this attack. To mitigate this attack you should turn of the services when not in use, and avoid the shared resources in a network.</em></p>]]></content>

As I told in my last two blogs of <strong>Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking</strong> series, this blog will give you the information related to the password cracking techniques. </p><p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong><br>It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the<br>tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will<br>have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are<br>understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.</p><hr><p><strong>CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:</strong></p><hr><ul><li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li><li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways</strong><br><strong>will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs.

Now again there are two scenrios, <br><br>-&gt; You will use it to recover your password, or your system administrator uses it to recover your passwords if you have forgotten it.<br><br>-&gt; Hackers use this to get unauthorized access to your account. And many of the accounts in the present day also have way too easy passwords.</p><h2 id="Password-Attacks"><a href="#Password-Attacks" class="headerlink" title="Password Attacks"></a><u>Password Attacks</u></h2><p>There are 4 types of password attacks:</p><ol><br><li><b><u>Non Electronic Attack:</u></b> No need of technical knowledge to crack the password.<br> -Shoulder Surfing<br> -Social Engineering<br> -Dumpster Diving</li><br><br><li><b><u>Active Online Attack:</u></b> Cracking password by continuously hitting to the target to get the hashes.<br> -Dictionary and Bruteforce attack<br> -Phishing<br> -Malwares<br> -Password Guessing <br> -NBT-NS/LLMNR poisoning</li><br><br><li><b><u>Passive Online Attack:</u></b> Just opposite of <b>Active Online Attack</b> where attacker don't have a direct connection to victim to crack passwords.<br> -<a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/MITM/">Man In The Middle Attack</a><br> -Wire Sniffing<br> -Replay Attack</li><br><br><li><b><u>Offline Attack:</u></b> Attacker gets the hashes of victim from victim's device and cracks it in his own machine.<br> -Rainbow Table Attack<br> -Distributed Network Attack</li></ol><br><br><h1 id="1-Non-Electronic-Attack"><a href="#1-Non-Electronic-Attack" class="headerlink" title="1. Non Electronic Attack"></a>1. <u>Non Electronic Attack</u></h1><h2 id="1-1-Social-Engineering"><a href="#1-1-Social-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Social Engineering"></a>1.1 <u>Social Engineering</u></h2><p>Social engineering is just an attack where the attacker tries to take advantage of human behaviour of trusting anyone easily. But attacker gets the credentials of the victim easily and use them later to access his account. Eg. Phishing, Pharming, Whaling etc.</p><h2 id="1-2-Shoulder-Surfing"><a href="#1-2-Shoulder-Surfing" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Shoulder Surfing"></a>1.2 <u>Shoulder Surfing</u></h2><p>Attacker is physically present behind you and is watching you typing you credentials, which he later uses to login to your account</p><h2 id="1-3-Dumpster-Diving"><a href="#1-3-Dumpster-Diving" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Dumpster Diving"></a>1.3 <u>Dumpster Diving</u></h2><p>Attacker finds something important like password, pin of you card in the garbage that you threw as a waste.<br><br><br><br></p><h1 id="2-Active-Online-Attack"><a href="#2-Active-Online-Attack" class="headerlink" title="2. Active Online Attack"></a>2. <u>Active Online Attack</u></h1><h2 id="2-1-Dictionary-Attack"><a href="#2-1-Dictionary-Attack" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Dictionary Attack"></a>2.1 <u>Dictionary Attack</u></h2><p>Attacker has a list of wordlist of password that the victim might be using, and tries them one by one to crack password.</p><h2 id="2-2-Bruteforce-Attack"><a href="#2-2-Bruteforce-Attack" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Bruteforce Attack"></a>2.2 <u>Bruteforce Attack</u></h2><p>The attacker tries each and every combination of word of each length to crack the password. Success rate is 100% but takes lot of time depending upon the password.</p><h2 id="2-3-Malwares"><a href="#2-3-Malwares" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Malwares"></a>2.3 <u>Malwares</u></h2><p>The victim installed a malware, spyware or keylogger accidentally, rather they are hidden in some application or exe file, which run in background to share each and every information of victim to the target.</p><h2 id="2-4-NBT-NS-LLMNR-Poisoning"><a href="#2-4-NBT-NS-LLMNR-Poisoning" class="headerlink" title="2.4 NBT-NS/LLMNR Poisoning"></a>2.4 <u>NBT-NS/LLMNR Poisoning</u></h2><p>The service running in Windows OS, to share the files in a Local Area Network, when not in use, then stop this service. So the attacker gets the hashes of password by poisoning the service of victim. Usually done in older versions of Windows OS, will show this in some other blog.</p><h2 id="2-5-Password-Guessing"><a href="#2-5-Password-Guessing" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Password Guessing"></a>2.5 <u>Password Guessing</u></h2><p>The attacker creates a list of passwords that the victim might be using and rate them of high to low probability. Checks them by entering them manually. Mainly done by those people who are very close to you.</p><h2 id="2-6-Password-Dumping"><a href="#2-6-Password-Dumping" class="headerlink" title="2.6 Password Dumping"></a>2.6 <u>Password Dumping</u></h2><p>Attacker directly interacts with victim machine, and extract all the password hashes stored in the machine.<br><br><br><br></p><h1 id="3-Passive-Online-Attack"><a href="#3-Passive-Online-Attack" class="headerlink" title="3. Passive Online Attack"></a>3. <u>Passive Online Attack</u></h1><h2 id="3-1-Wire-Sniffing"><a href="#3-1-Wire-Sniffing" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Wire Sniffing"></a>3.1 <u>Wire Sniffing</u></h2><p>The attacker uses the tools like wireshark and pwdump to get all your packets being transferred, and analyzes them to get some important information such as passwords and user ID.</p><h2 id="3-2-Man-In-The-Middle-Attack-MITM"><a href="#3-2-Man-In-The-Middle-Attack-MITM" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Man In The Middle Attack (MITM)"></a>3.2 <u><a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/MITM/">Man In The Middle Attack (MITM)</a></u></h2><p>As discussed in the last blog, I was able to see the password and the username of the victim machine. Also I was able to change them in my attacker’s machine.</p><h2 id="3-3-Replay-Attack"><a href="#3-3-Replay-Attack" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Replay Attack"></a>3.3 <u>Replay Attack</u></h2><p>The attacker gets the session ID OR token of the victim, and then uses the same token to login to the victim’s account.<br><br><br><br></p><h1 id="4-Offline-Attack"><a href="#4-Offline-Attack" class="headerlink" title="4. Offline Attack"></a>4. <u>Offline Attack</u></h1><h2 id="4-1-Creating-Rainbow-Tables"><a href="#4-1-Creating-Rainbow-Tables" class="headerlink" title="4.1 Creating Rainbow Tables"></a>4.1 <u>Creating Rainbow Tables</u></h2><p>The rainbow table consistes of the hashes of the dictionary or the bruteforced list, and those hashes are compared by the hashes captured by the attacker.</p><h2 id="4-2-Distributed-Network-Attack"><a href="#4-2-Distributed-Network-Attack" class="headerlink" title="4.2 Distributed Network Attack"></a>4.2 <u>Distributed Network Attack</u></h2><p>The password is cracked by a group of computers in a network, in order to get the speedy crack of the passwords. Each computer tries different word, the list is designed in such a way that there is no clashes in the wordlist.<br><br><br><br></p><h1 id="What-Is-SAM-database-in-Windows"><a href="#What-Is-SAM-database-in-Windows" class="headerlink" title="What Is SAM database in Windows?"></a><u>What Is SAM database in Windows?</u></h1><p>In windows OS, the passwords are stored is SAM database, in the NTLM hashed format. When you login in to your system after booting, the password you entered are matched with this file only. This file cannot be copied or moved or deleted from this path. Neither you can open this file, even if you open it then also the file is encrypted, you will unable to understand it. So the attacker performs the <strong>Active Online Attack</strong> to gets the password. He can dump the hashes from this file using the tool <strong>Pwdump</strong>. <br></p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin1.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><br><h1 id="What-is-Shadow-File-in-Linux"><a href="#What-is-Shadow-File-in-Linux" class="headerlink" title="What is Shadow File in Linux?"></a><u>What is Shadow File in Linux?</u></h1><p>Just like you had a SAM database in windows to store all the password hashes of the user present on the sytem, in the same way, in linux there is a <strong>Sahadow</strong> file in <strong>/etc/</strong> directory, which stores the password of easch and every user present there. You can edit it unlike SAM file in Windows. Afterall the root user of Linux has more power than the Adminstrator of the Windows.</p><br><br><h1 id="Password-Cracking-Tools"><a href="#Password-Cracking-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Password Cracking Tools"></a><u>Password Cracking Tools</u></h1><h2 id="1-For-Windows-OS"><a href="#1-For-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="1. For Windows OS"></a>1. <u>For Windows OS</u></h2><h3 id="1-1-L0phtCrack-6"><a href="#1-1-L0phtCrack-6" class="headerlink" title="1.1 L0phtCrack 6"></a>1.1 <u>L0phtCrack 6</u></h3><p>This is a vast tool for cracking the passwords from the hashes. You can customize this tool according to you. It provides you the interface where you can select the options to select the type of dictionary attack to perform, whether you need the alpha-numeric or only alphabets to use in dictionary. Also at the end of dictionary it starts with the bruteforce attack. Also it directly detects the hashes and username in the current system you are working, and starts performing the cracking for them. You can change those hashes with the file you got from pwdump tool. Following are the snapshots of L0phtCrack.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin2.PNG" alt="hack"> </p><br><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin3.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><h3 id="1-2-Ophcrack"><a href="#1-2-Ophcrack" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Ophcrack"></a>1.2 <u>Ophcrack</u></h3><p>Another great tool which uses the rainbow tables to crack the hashes. You ge the various options regarding what hashes they are, LM or NTLM, or you can directly load the file of pwdump and select the rainbow tables from the <strong>Crack</strong> option in its title bar. And start it to crack the hashes. Following are the snapshots of Ophcrack. <br></p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin5.PNG" alt="hack"> </p><br><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin4.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><br><h2 id="2-For-Linux-OS"><a href="#2-For-Linux-OS" class="headerlink" title="2.

This tool can perform bruteforce as well as dictionary attack on any type of hashes, such as MD5, SHA1, SHA2, LM etc. If password is not cracked from dictionary and bruteforce will surely crack the password. I used this tool in <a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/Hacking2/">System Hacking (Linux)</a> blog. Following snapshot shows the same hash cracking that I used in L0ph and Oph crack, but with the help of <strong>John the ripper</strong> tool.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin6.PNG" alt="hack"></p><br><h3 id="2-2-Hydra-wizard"><a href="#2-2-Hydra-wizard" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Hydra-wizard"></a>2.2 <u>Hydra-wizard</u></h3><p>This is again most usable tool for getting the password of any service such as SSH, FTP, MySql server etc. You just need to enter the IP of target, the username or the file containing the username, the password to try or the file containing the passwords. It will start the dictionary attack. I used this tool in <a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/Hacking2/">System Hacking (Linux)</a> blog. Following snapshot shows the hydra-wizrd which is trying to crack the password for ssh service for root user on other deecice.<br></p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/passwordcrackin7.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br></p><h3 id="2-3-Aircrack-ng"><a href="#2-3-Aircrack-ng" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Aircrack-ng"></a>2.3 <u>Aircrack-ng</u></h3><p>The tool which is used to crack the wifi passwords from the .cap file you have got. This tool I will be discussing at the time of wifi-cracking blog.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><em>In this blog I showed you various password cracking methodologies and their tools. It depends on the password how complex it is, like <strong>p@s$w0Rd</strong> will take a lot of time to be cracked while <strong>password</strong> will be cracked in few minutes during the bruteforce.</em></p><p><br><br></p><p><b><i>In the next blog I will show how NBT-NS/LLMNR poisoning can be done and how the password of victim Windows machine can be cracked after this poisoning. This attack is more prominent in the Local Area Network.</i></b></p>]]></content>

Any third party app or any other apk from the non trustable website can lead to our device compromisation, which I showed with the help of a demo where the android based device got hacked with the help of a small apk. Yes I remember that I had to discuss the various techniques to perform password cracking, but that blog I will be sharing after this. And believe me this blog will also going to be very intersting.<br><br></p><p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong><br>It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too).

Also the intersting thing about this is that the attacker can also manipulate the data that is being sent from client to server. So if the client is accessing some HTTP based website then the credentials will be viible to the attacker, but if the client is accessing some HTTPS based website, then he will gradually have to decrypt the credentials. But still it can be manipulated. So in this way this attack is different from sniffing attack.</p><h2 id="More-On-MITM"><a href="#More-On-MITM" class="headerlink" title="More On MITM"></a><u>More On MITM</u></h2><p>The attacker in this attack tries different methods to split the existing connection between the client and server. Maybe DOS ttack can also work. DOS is also an attack, I will discuss it in later blog. Similar to Man In The Middle attack is Man In The Browser attack, where the browser gets compromised. </p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">IN NORMAL CONNECTION     </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">   | CLIENT&#39;s |&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;

And yes it is good to be curious. Let’s see how this is done:</p><h2 id="Attack"><a href="#Attack" class="headerlink" title="Attack"></a><u>Attack</u></h2><ol><li style="font-size:110%;">I have one attacking machine with Kali linux and victim machine Windows 7</li><li style="font-size:110%;">I have already setup some setting in attacker's machine related to the proxy.</li><li style="font-size:110%;">Now I opened <b>burpsuite</b> and did the required changes for the attack, shown in the snapshot below.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm1.PNG"/><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm2.PNG"/><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">The snapshot below shows the Victim's machine where the browser is opened.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm3.PNG" /><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">I entered <a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a> and press the enter button on keyboard.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm4.PNG" /><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">The moment I press the enter the page starts loading and the request is sent to the attacker's machine. Where I press on forward button to forward this request to browser.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm5.PNG" /><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">The same happens when I open its <a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php"><b>Signup</b></a> and forwarded that request to the server to open this page shown below. And I enetered the <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> there and click on login button.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm6.PNG"/><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">The request is again sent to my attacker's machine where <b>uname</b> and <b>pass</b> is showing the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> I entered in victim's machine.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm7.PNG"/><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">I can easily change the fields of <b>uname</b> and <b>pass</b>. As shown below.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm8.PNG"/><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">But I at last change the <b>uname</b> and <b>pass</b> fields to <b>test</b> and <b>test</b>. Which are the default username and password of the signup page.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm9.PNG"/><br><br><br><li style="font-size:110%;">Now see the username that is logged in to the page. The username with <b>test</b> username i.e. <b>John Smith</b> is logged in.</li><br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm10.PNG"/><br><br></ol><br><p>In the same way other malicious things are performed, such as stealing session IDs and all, are also performed by the hackers with unethical mindset. Now the latest versions can also detect the attacks, if they are happening with you, but still there are many ways to bypass. This way the MITM is performed and your data can be compromised.<br><br></p><hr><p><b><i>In this blog I discussed the concept of MITM and also I showed a demo on MITM attack.

      <title>System Hacking (Android)</title>
      <link href="/2021-04-07-Hacking3/"/>
      <url>/2021-04-07-Hacking3/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/androidbanner.jpg" alt="image1" height="325" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://fossbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/android-hacking-app-2017.jpg">here</a></caption><hr><p>In my last blog I discussed the techniques regarding how the Linux OS got hacked with the help of exploiting <strong>SSH service</strong> as it was running in privileged mode, and this was done because the services were running even when they were not in use and someone might try to use it in unethical way.Similarly the other services can be exploited in unethical way, it just depends upon the attacker. For Android hacking assume that we have performed footprinting, scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessment for the target, we have to start with the system<br>hacking. So, now we are ready to start with system hacking.</p><p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong><br>It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the<br>tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will<br>have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are<br>understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.</p><hr><p><strong>CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:</strong></p><hr><ul><li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li><li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways</strong><br><strong>will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t</strong><br><strong>you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking</strong><br><strong>something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep</strong><br><strong>a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.</strong></p><hr><hr><h1 id="How-Android-Gets-Hacked"><a href="#How-Android-Gets-Hacked" class="headerlink" title="How Android Gets Hacked"></a><u>How Android Gets Hacked</u></h1><p>Android is a linux based mobile operating system. For android, again we have suitable modules present in the <strong>Metasploit Framework</strong>. But for educational purpose, that how your phone can also be hacked if you download some cracked version of any apk from some website which is not a trusted one may end up with your android phone hacked. In the current world where many games are being build up for android platform, such as <strong>pubg</strong>, players try to get various mods and hacks in order to improve there gameplay, or to boost their XPs. They simply get the paid utilities in original apk, totally free of cost, but there is nothing in this universe that you get free of cost. If you got those utilities then there is something which <em>“they” are getting in return</em> OR <em>“they” will get in future</em>. As I discussed in the blog of Windows OS hacking, it is a risky task to download some third-party apps. These apps may be sharing your phone’s data in the backend and you might not even know.</p><h2 id="Lab-Setup"><a href="#Lab-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Lab Setup"></a><u>Lab Setup</u></h2><ol><li>Android phone</li><li>Kali Linux<br></li></ol><h1 id="Scenario-and-Steps"><a href="#Scenario-and-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Scenario and Steps"></a><u>Scenario and Steps</u></h1><p>In this, suppose an android user is searching for an apk can increase the battery life of the phone, and came accross an apk name <strong>MainActivity.apk</strong>. Which he downloaded to check if this apk helps his/hers device. Following ar the steps how I will gain the access to this victim’s android phone:<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android1.png" alt="hack"><br><br></p><ol><li><p>I will again use the <strong>exploit/multi/handler</strong> module, because the application that is being accessed by the victim will try to connect to my device in backend. Following snapshot shows my MSF shell:<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android2.png" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>I have set the options of this module and started listening for some connections at port 1212. Following snapshot shows setting the values of options of the module.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android3.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>Now run the exploit to listen for connections.</p></li><li><p>As soon as the victim opens the <strong>MainActivity.apk</strong>, the reverse connection to my MSF is created. Run <strong>sysinfo</strong> command to get the system details of the device which has connected to MSF.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android4.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>I can dump the contacts and messages of the android phone, turn on his camera, get the live streaming of his screen, unlock his phone remotely, start any apk at its phone etc etc. One of these things I have shone below.<br><br>This snapshot below shows the messages of victim device.</p></li></ol><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android6.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br></p><p>This snapshot below shows the contact information of victim device.</p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android7.PNG" alt="hack"><br><br></p><p>This snapshot below shows the dumping of victim’s contact information and messages into a file.</p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android5.PNG" alt="hack"></p><ol start="6"><li><p>The snapshot below showing the contact list I got after dumping to my attacker’s machine.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android8.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>The snapshot below showing the messages I got after dumping to my attacker’s machine.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android9.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>The snapshot below shows the list of applications installed in victim’s device. The list was longer, not all applications are present in this snapshot.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/android10.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li></ol><br><p>This was a basic demo attack that I shown in this blog, <strong>just to show you how the hackers can get your android phone, why you should not install the applications from the third-party websites</strong>. You have to make yourself aware about how your device can be exploited because of your mistake. There are other ways also how your device can be exploited, <strong>And one warning: NEVER ROOT YOUR ANDROID DEVICE, because this will log you into admin mode of android, and you saw in Linux hacking blog, what was the result of running the service in prileged mode.</strong><br></p><br><p><em>I hope this blog was informative to those of cyber security peeps out there and to other people as well, might have given you the idea what not to do in your Android devices.</em> <br><br><em>In my next blog I will be discussing various techniques to crack the passwords, as I mentioned earlier in my Linux hacking blog.</em> </p>]]></content>

      <title>Getting Started With Cyber Forensics</title>
      <link href="/2021-04-06-CyberForensic/"/>
      <url>/2021-04-06-CyberForensic/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/CyberForensics/forensic.jpg" alt="image1" height="325" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://www.mbis-inc.net/image.jpg?v=fca8addf769f2f2037a8bf9">here</a></caption><hr><p>This is the another series besides <strong>Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking</strong> where I will be discussing about need of cyber forensics and various tools used in cyber forensics and how to use them. Like the series of <strong>Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking</strong>, this will also going to be an interesting series and very informative about the another domain of Cyber Security.</p><p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong> <br><br>This series comprises of various tools and some of them would be engaged in changing some system configurations and changes in registry of Windows OS also. So my advice is to you all is to have a virtual machine of Windows 7 OR Windows 8, Kali Linux installed in your host machines, rather than changing the configurations of host OS. You can also download Santoku linux as well, we might be needing that also.<br><br></p><hr><h1 id="Need-of-Cyber-Forensics"><a href="#Need-of-Cyber-Forensics" class="headerlink" title="Need of Cyber Forensics"></a><u>Need of Cyber Forensics</u></h1><p>We all come across various articles about some server got hacked, data breach occured; recently the data of Facebook was compromised, also the data breach case of Mobikwik was also into news highlights. Specially this thing increased along with the social engineering attacks during the lockdown period where most of the people were losing their jobs and most have to work with less salaries. Ultimately it was a great opportunity for the hackers around the globe in order to steal money as they see such things as an opportunity to earn money. <strong>But that’s not good you should not be using your skills in wrong direction</strong>.<br><br>Now such things are running paralelly across the globe, but we need some defense system too. Yeah we do have <strong>Ethical Hackers</strong> too who are working for some organization and also for the government, but when the attack happens the cyber security experts also need to know about what was the vulnerablity that got exploited, and also they need to trace the hacker also who did it, so that they can take some legal actions against him/her. Or if some crime happened regarding blackmailing where the criminal had some objectional photos or videos or any private data of victim and asking him to give ransom in return to get them deleted otherwise he/she would viral that thing to defame victim.<br><br>Now the victim complaint to the police about the same and police went to the criminal in order to search the storage device where he/she had kept the data stored, This could be the hardisk or pendrive or memory card also. But when police reached to the cromonal’s home they found no data in the storage device. But the victim knew that it was present there. So there is the complete chance of the criminal that he might have deleted the data that he was having, because of the fear of imprisonment. Here comes the use of <strong>Cyber Forensic</strong> team again, in order to scan the hard drive or any other storage device carefully and retreiving that data which was stored on that storage device. So they were able to retrieve the data which he/she was using to blackmail the victim and the criminal was imprisoned for his acts.<br><br></p><h1 id="Another-Scenario-For-The-Use-Of-Cyber-Forensics"><a href="#Another-Scenario-For-The-Use-Of-Cyber-Forensics" class="headerlink" title="Another Scenario For The Use Of Cyber Forensics"></a><u>Another Scenario For The Use Of Cyber Forensics</u></h1><p>Let’s see the another scenario where the need of <strong>Cyber Forensics</strong> will become more clear. Let’s suppose you have a proprietry data which is very important to you and no other copy is present in the world. You have stored the data in a hard drive which consists of no other data, means the proprietry data is isolated from the other data. And now you are going to publish that thing in the form of software or research paper. But some mishappening occurs, in such a way that the hardisk was burnt or got damaged. In this case also the forensics team work on the storage device in order to retrieve the data back, they try assembling various sectrs together, means it is a very patienceful task. Yeah, the whole data will not be recovered now but yes much of it could be recovered. So such things also happen in real life.</p><h1 id="Tools-Needed-for-Cyber-Forensics"><a href="#Tools-Needed-for-Cyber-Forensics" class="headerlink" title="Tools Needed for Cyber Forensics"></a><u>Tools Needed for Cyber Forensics</u></h1><p>To understand the concept of cyber forensics, you need to install the following softwares and we will be using one by one:<br></p><ol><li><a href="https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4-5">FTK Imager (Windows Version) </a></li><li><a href="https://www.autopsy.com/download/">Autopsy (Windows Version)</a></li><li><a href="https://hex-workshop.en.softonic.com/">Hex Workshop</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pstools">PS Tools</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/listdlls">List DLLs</a></li><li><a href="https://accessdata.com/product-download/registry-viewer-1-8-0-5">Registry Viewer</a><br></li></ol><p>We will be using most of the tools that are mentioned above, surely these tools will give you a feel of being a forensic expert at the end as we will move forward in this series.<br></p><p><strong>This blog was an introductory blog to tell you how cyber forensics come into action and I also discussed two cases, there are other applications also but never mind I will let you know all those things as we will further proceed. So in next blog I will show how and when to use the tools mentioned above.</strong></p>]]></content>

And most probably I would discuss about other modules too. They are easy to use, just like we used our /multi/handler module. You just have to change their options to make the work fine. Also the right module should be selected at right time, otherwise the module will not work. For Linux hacking assume that we have performed footprinting, scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessment for the target, we have to start with the system<br>hacking. So, now we are ready to start with system hacking.</p><p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong><br>It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the<br>tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will<br>have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are<br>understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.</p><hr><p><strong>CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:</strong></p><hr><ul><li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li><li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways</strong><br><strong>will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t</strong><br><strong>you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking</strong><br><strong>something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep</strong><br><strong>a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.</strong></p><hr><hr><p>This is a short blog because Linux is basically a way different OS than windows, which does not supports exe files. All you need to scan is for misconfiguration or loophole in order to hack the Linux OS.</p><h1 id="Scenario"><a href="#Scenario" class="headerlink" title="Scenario"></a><u>Scenario</u></h1><p>So we are always told that the linux operating system is the safest operating system. You never get hacked with Linux OS. But the fact is if you have vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, or week passwords even then also even if you are using Linux or any other OS, you will be hacked easily. So in this blog I am going to show how Linux can also be hacked if some misconfigurations are there.<br></p><h2 id="Lab-Setup"><a href="#Lab-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Lab Setup"></a><u>Lab Setup</u></h2><ol><li>Two Linux machines<br><br>-&gt; One of then shoud be kali<br></li></ol><h1 id="Hacking-Linux"><a href="#Hacking-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Hacking Linux"></a><u>Hacking Linux</u></h1><p>So now I will show that how <strong>secured OS</strong> also gets hacked due to some misconfigurations and the negligence of the administrator of the Linux OS.<br></p><ol><li>During the scan I got that the target linux machine is having SSH service open.</li><li>Now if somehow I get /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file from that target, it will be great.</li><li>The target device is logged in as privileged user. If it is not so then you can compromise the user itself and do privilege escalation.</li><li>So since here the target is logged in as privileged user then it is not a big deal.</li><li>Get the password of root by using hydra. The following snapshot shows the method to get the root password with the help of ssh service.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/hydra.PNG" alt="hack"></li><li>Now we can get the copy of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file with the help of file sharing command such as scp <strong>scp [Victim IP]:[filename] [destination to save the copied file]</strong> or simply with <strong>ssh [username]@[IP]</strong> and entering password then getting the data of the file.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/scp.PNG" alt="hack"></li><li>Use command <strong>unshadow passwd shadow &gt; newshadow</strong> to map the usernames and there password hashes.</li><li>Then crack the hashes with <strong>john the ripper</strong> or if you have some other persnalized dictionary.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/john.PNG" alt="hack"></li></ol><br>These are the basic ways where a person who don't have much knowledge about the configurations, and running services on default settings can get attacked. Turn off the services which are not in use always. This was about the single SSH service, there are other ways too.<br><p>I will also discuss the techniques to get the password hashes and various ways to crack them in my upcoming blogs also. Till then use <strong>john the ripper</strong> tool. <em>Also I will show how the android devices can also be hacked in the similar way I showed you about Windows OS.</em></p>]]></content>

The very first version had only few modules aroud 4 I guess, but later as a project<br>It gradually expanded and now it is a full fledge tool for the penetration testers. You have got a very powerfull console which can do:</p><ol><li>Enumeration</li><li>Vulnerability assessment</li><li>Fuzzing</li><li>Cracking passwords</li><li>Dumping hashes</li><li>Scanning<br>and what not related to penetration testing. So the <strong>Metasploit Framework</strong> is a very vast topic which I will be discussing in some other blog. Till then you can have a look at our video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSslLaEu9ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSslLaEu9ms</a>.<br></li></ol><p><strong>One important thing related to MSF is whenever you use the exploit module then you have to use the payload for that module too.</strong></p><br>Currently in this blog I will show you how you can get a reverse connection from a target Windows OS and do what not with that system as an attacker. The Windows OS will become the victim machine, and I will show how to hack it.<br><p><strong>Basically this attack is just to show you all emerging hackers that what happens if you download any software from an illegitimate website or get any cracked version of sme paid software from some website.</strong></p><h2 id="Lab-Setup"><a href="#Lab-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Lab Setup"></a><u>Lab Setup</u></h2><ol><li><p>Windows OS<br><br>-&gt; Windows XP<br><br>-&gt; Windows 7<br><br>-&gt; Windows 8  (Turn off the defender)<br><br>-&gt; Windows 10 (Turn off the defender)<br></p></li><li><p>Kali Linux</p></li></ol><p>Though we can bypass the defender, but for that I will need to change some code and add some random things to it. But for now to understand I am attempting on a basic level.<br><br></p><h1 id="Hacking-Windows-OS"><a href="#Hacking-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Hacking Windows OS"></a><u>Hacking Windows OS</u></h1><ol><li><p>I created an executable file named as <b>vuln.exe</b> for the Windows OS, which will act as a cracked software of a paid software that the victim was trying to get from many days. And now this executable file is installed on the victim machine.<br><br>The snapshot below shows the victim machine of Windows 7 OS, installed with <strong>vuln.exe</strong> file.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/vuln.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>Open the msf in kali with the command <strong>msfconsole -q</strong> OR <strong>msfconsole</strong>. Difference is, in first one you will not get the banner and second one you will get the banner. It’s up to you, which one you want. You will get the screen as shown below:<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/msf.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>Now I will use the <strong>exploit/multi/handler</strong> module which is used for handling various payloads. And to see its options use <strong>show options</strong>. Set LPORT and LHOST, which is listening port and listening host IP address. I will also set the payload <strong>windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</strong> which helps me in getting the reverse shell of windows.</p></li><li><p>Following snapshot shows the final settings of the <strong>exploit/multi/handler</strong> module.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/msfoptions.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>Now we are ready to start the exploit, by running <strong>exploit</strong> command.</p></li><li><p>Now we will get the connection from widows machine as soon as that exe file runs in the victim’s machine.</p></li><li><p>Following snapshot shows the reverse connection established at the msf, and we got the meterpreter shell.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/shell.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p>You can get the live view of the desktop, upload or download files to it, turn on his device’s camera, get NTLM hashes of SAM file etc etc.. The SAM file concept is discussed in <a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/PasswordCrack/">Cracking Password</a> blog. Following is the snapshot for dumping hashes of the password of victim’s machine.<br><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/hashdump.PNG" alt="hack"></p></li><li><p> After this you can also create a persistence, so that next time when the victim comes online again, then also the connection is created automatically.</p><br></li></ol><p><strong>All these steps were used to show you the demo about what all could happen if you download any software from illegitimate website. You can get hacked in the same way too. So avoid such cracked versions, or if you download then it should be trustable one.</strong><br><br><em>Similarly I will be discussing the same for hacking the Linux OS in upcoming blogs. Also I will be discussing how to crack the hashes, that we got in the above meterpreter shell or by some other methods too.</em></p>]]></content>

So the system/device haing some vulnerabilities is known as<br>a vulnerable system. Why so? because that system/device is prone to attacks. These vulnerabilities can be due to the misconfigurations in<br>the device, such as misconfigured firewalls. And sometimes the device becomes vulnerable if some software/application starts doing malicious things<br>or it can be a backdoor too, which helps the attackers to get into the target device. These vulnerabilities help attacker to explit them and get<br>into the device. I will be discussing about malwares in upcoming blogs, but in this blog<br>we will see how we can do vulnerability assessment.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-Vulnerability-Research"><a href="#What-is-a-Vulnerability-Research" class="headerlink" title="What is a Vulnerability Research"></a><u>What is a Vulnerability Research</u></h2><p>Vulnerability research refers to identifying and discovering various vulnerablities which can lead to an attack to the vulnerable device. Goals of this research is:</p><ol><li>Gathering information regarding various vulnerabiliies and their ways of getting exploited.</li><li>Find the vulnerabilities before someone else does it and exploit them.</li><li>How to fix those vulnerabilities?</li></ol><p>On the basis of severity level, vulnerabilities are categorized into 3 parts:</p><ol><li>Low severity</li><li>Medium severity</li><li>High severity</li></ol><h2 id="Classification-of-Vulnerabilities"><a href="#Classification-of-Vulnerabilities" class="headerlink" title="Classification of Vulnerabilities"></a><u>Classification of Vulnerabilities</u></h2><ul><li><b>Unpatched Servers</b></li><li><b>Operating System Flaws</b></li><li><b>Default Installation</b></li><li><b>Application Flaws</b></li><li><b>Default Passwords</b></li><li><b>Design Flaws</b></li><li><b>Open Services</b></li><li><b>Misconfiguration</b></li><li><b>Buffer Overflows</b></li></ul><h3 id="1-Unpatched-Servers"><a href="#1-Unpatched-Servers" class="headerlink" title="1. Unpatched Servers"></a><b><u>1. Unpatched Servers</u></b></h3><p>Server is just a computer where the organization’s data is stored centrally, also the websites are hosted on the servers only. Compromizing the server<br>means compromizing the data present in the server or the website that is being hosted on the server. If the server is not patched with the latest patches<br>then it will have the known vunerabilities in it. Patches are made availabele by the OS manufacturer to fix some past vulnerabilities, and when the patches<br>are launched then the vulnerabilities that are being patched are also known, which helps the attackers to exploit those vunerabilities easily.</p><h3 id="2-Operating-System-Flaws"><a href="#2-Operating-System-Flaws" class="headerlink" title="2. Operating System Flaws"></a><b><u>2. Operating System Flaws</u></b></h3><p>Vulnerabilities present in Operating System can lead to a risk to a device by the malwares, or some malcious codes/scripts that are run on the device. By this the attacker can get various information<br>stored in the device, ultimately leading to the data loss. Solution to this is to regularly patching the OS and also have antivirus installed on the device<br>of some good company.</p><h3 id="3-Default-Installation"><a href="#3-Default-Installation" class="headerlink" title="3. Default Installation"></a><b><u>3. Default Installation</u></b></h3><p>Default installation is different from default passwords. This refers to the default softwares/applcations that are installed in the device beforehand so that device can easily be used when it is booted first<br>time. For example: you get internet explorer installed on the Windows OS, so that you can at least get connected to the internet with it, rather you all download chrome browser with the help of explorer with it.<br>So if the attacker finds the vulnerabilty on such default installed applications, though he will not find much information on the target device by exploiting it but he might get the information related to<br>network or any other device to which he got connected. So you should change the settings of such applications before using them.</p><h3 id="4-Application-Flaws"><a href="#4-Application-Flaws" class="headerlink" title="4. Application Flaws"></a><b><u>4. Application Flaws</u></b></h3><p>Application flaws means the vulnerabilities that have occured due to improper validation schemes applied, or less coding capabilities of the developer. The attackers can use it for data tampering or data theft.<br>SQL injection attack is one such attack which is done by parameter tampering and using SQL commands in input fields. If proper validation of input data is applied to the application then the chances of such<br>exploits become very less.</p><h3 id="5-Default-Passwords"><a href="#5-Default-Passwords" class="headerlink" title="5. Default Passwords"></a><b><u>5. Default Passwords</u></b></h3><p>This is a common vulnerability, generally found in routers and IOT devices, where people don’t change the password of their device, and use it<br>without changing the password that was set by the company by default for that device. So attacker can easily find the default password from any search engine, and can use that password<br>to start using the device, and the device owner doesn’t even knows it that. Attacker can use the device in such malicious ways then.</p><h3 id="6-Design-Flaws"><a href="#6-Design-Flaws" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Flaws"></a><b><u>6. Design Flaws</u></b></h3><p>Vulnerabilities due to design flaws are present in all those application/softwares where the applaication is being used. For example the poor vaalidation techniques in input area, or incorrect encryption, or data structure.<br>Attacker can try to bypass the input validations any try to steal some confidential information.</p><h3 id="7-Open-Services"><a href="#7-Open-Services" class="headerlink" title="7.

Open Services</u></b></h3><p>Open services refers to the ports that are open in the sevice, such as port 20,21 etc. If the service is not in use, then it is advisable to close the port<br>otherwise the service can be used by the attacker to exploit someway or the other and create a connection between the victim and attacker’s device. Network breeching can also happenif the ports are unnecessarily kept open.</p><h3 id="8-Misconfiguration"><a href="#8-Misconfiguration" class="headerlink" title="8. Misconfiguration"></a><b><u>8. Misconfiguration</u></b></h3><p>The root cause of many vulnerabilities is because of misconfigurations. For exampe, you have enabled the firewall but it is not properly configured, then it is of no use. Other misconfguration is, if you are running unnecessary services<br>on the device, banner grabbing is also possible by the attacker, because the website is hosted on the server with default settings.</p><h3 id="9-Buffer-Overflows"><a href="#9-Buffer-Overflows" class="headerlink" title="9. Buffer Overflows"></a><b><u>9. Buffer Overflows</u></b></h3><p>Another vulnerablity where the attacker can send random data to the victim’s device, by DOS attack, any the buffer or you can say the queue  of requests at the server side<br>becomes full and overflows, so it cannot handle more requests now. And therefore the victim’s device hangs and ultimately he has to take his device down from the network and restart it.</p><h2 id="What-can-Vulnerability-Scanners-do"><a href="#What-can-Vulnerability-Scanners-do" class="headerlink" title="What can Vulnerability Scanners do?"></a><u>What can Vulnerability Scanners do?</u></h2><p>Vulnerability scanners or vulnerability assessment tools can easily detect the known security weaknesses in a network or device and helps in securing the device<br>by showing the severity level of each vulnerability. Other goals of vulnerability scanners are:</p><ol><li>Identifying the OS and its version running in the device</li><li>Detect ports in listening mode</li><li>Vulnerable applications installed</li><li>Accounts with weak passwords</li><li>Default services running</li><li>Misconfigurations with firewall<br></li></ol><h2 id="Types-of-Vulnerability-Assessment"><a href="#Types-of-Vulnerability-Assessment" class="headerlink" title="Types of Vulnerability Assessment"></a><u>Types of Vulnerability Assessment</u></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Active Assessment</td><td>In this scanning the network, hosts and services vulnerabilities are sacanned.

In fact the tools we used in Linux,<br>the same tools can be used in Windows OS. They are GUI based applications. You can easily install and use in Windows OS<br>if you are clear how to use in Linux OS. Now let’s start with another step after scanning in this series of <b>Cyber Security<br>and Ethical Hacking</b>.</p><p><strong>Attention Future Hackers</strong><br>It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the<br>tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will<br>have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are<br>understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.</p><hr><p><strong>CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:</strong></p><hr><ul><li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li><li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways</strong><br><strong>will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t</strong><br><strong>you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking</strong><br><strong>something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep</strong><br><strong>a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.</strong></p><hr><h1 id="What-is-enumeration"><a href="#What-is-enumeration" class="headerlink" title="What is enumeration?"></a>What is enumeration?</h1><p>Enumeration is just extraction of extra information regarding the target network, device such as the NetBios name, routing tables, shared resources, user names<br>group names of the target device. With the help of the attackers could find the pre identified vulnerabilities about the target. Following are the possible scenarios during enumeration:</p><ol><li>You get an email. Now you can find the username of the person who sent you the email. You can find the domain name and server used by the sender, who sent<br>you the email. So this is also a type of enumeration.</li><li>Sometines the routers are configured with default passwords from the company itself, and is remain unchanged. So this makes easier to attack such routers or<br>any device which is configured with default passwords.</li><li>Active Directory enumeration is done. This is a feature in Windows OS, which can be easily bruteforced to get the valid usernames, and their respective<br>passwords can also be cracked.</li><li>Usernames,group names and SID can be extracted by the attacker during enumeration.</li></ol><h2 id="Other-Enumerations"><a href="#Other-Enumerations" class="headerlink" title="Other Enumerations"></a><u>Other Enumerations</u></h2><p>Some enumeration types I have mentioned above and some are briefly discussed below. The below table is a gist of enumeration types, the important ones are further discussed below this table.<br></p><table><thead><tr><th>Enumeration Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>DNS zone transfer</strong></td><td>Generally communication between DNS client and server is done through UDP port 53, but if the size of the message exceeds the limit then the communication is done over TCP port. Some malwares use the same DNS port number 53 to exploit vulnerabilities in DNS server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NetBios Name Service</strong></td><td>NetBios Name Servers maintain a database of NetBios names for the host and their respective IPs. This service is used when you share the data among Windows OS in LAN, to do name resolutions. That’s why attackers are interested in attacking name servers.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NetBios Session Service</strong></td><td>Service is used during the file transfer in a network in Windows OS. Null seesions are established and resources sharing is done with the help of this service. Attackers try to attack this service to get unauthorized access of critical file system resulting to data theft.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Simple Network Management Protocol</strong></td><td>Protocol simply used for network management, attached to the devices such as firewalls, switches, other services etc. So attacker can get useful information if he is able to intercept the requests and rsponse messages.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</strong></td><td>This protocol maintains distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol network. Basically LDAP enumeration is done in Windows OS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Simple Mail Transport Protocol</strong></td><td>This protocol is used in transfering emails over internet. This is a connection oriented protocol.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3 id="1-NetBios-Enumeration"><a href="#1-NetBios-Enumeration" class="headerlink" title="1. NetBios Enumeration"></a>1. <u>NetBios Enumeration</u></h3><p>NetBios as discussed earlier is a unique name of the device, which is used during the transmission of data in a network. It is of 16 ASCII characters, out of which 15 characters are used to destinguish device<br>and 16th character is reserved for service or name record type. So during the enumeration of NetBios attacker can get a list of devices belonging to a domain, policies, passwords, services running etc.</p><p><b>Command:</b> nbtstat -[options]<br><br>The command is used to see the NetBios name. Just type <b>nbtstat</b> in the command prompt of your windows operating system and you will be able to see various options along with its descriptions. You will surely get the output in terms of netbios names if it is present in your cache. In my case there were no NetBios name present in my cache so I didn’t get any output.</p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/nbtstatoptions.PNG" alt="nbtstatoptions"><br><br><br></p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/nbtstatcmd.PNG" alt="nbtstatcmd"><br><br><br></p><p>Apart from this you can use various tools for NetBios enumeration. One such tool is <b>NetBios Enumerator</b>. This is a simple tool used for NetBios enumeration with simple GUI and options. Following is the output when I scanned with this tool over an IP range.</p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/enumtool.PNG" alt="enumtool"><br><br><br>So it displayed me the netbios name of the machine which is in the same network and also it displayed me the MAC address of the machine. So in these two ways you can do NetBios enumeration.</p><h3 id="2-Enumerating-User-Accounts"><a href="#2-Enumerating-User-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="2. Enumerating User Accounts"></a>2. <u>Enumerating User Accounts</u></h3><p>This can be easily done if you can easily connect to the target device. And you just need the PsTools. These are developed by Microsoft, and is a collection of tools that can provide a lot of information about the device.<br>You can download the tool from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pstools">here</a>. Just unzip it and try executing from the command prompt on your computer or similarly the attacker can take the tools in the pendrive and try them on target device by lending the device from the victim for some time.<br>PsTools contains a set of small utility applications that help in gaing various information regarding the device. Some of these are:<br><br></p><table><thead><tr><th>Tool Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PsGetSid</td><td>Display the SID of user</td></tr><tr><td>PsFile</td><td>Shows remotely opened files</td></tr><tr><td>PsInfo</td><td>Provides various information about the system</td></tr><tr><td>PsPasswd</td><td>Changes the password of account</td></tr><tr><td>PsList</td><td>Provides details of processes running in the system</td></tr><tr><td>PsKill</td><td>Kills any process with process ID</td></tr><tr><td>PsLoggedOn</td><td>Provides information regarding who are logged on locally and via resource sharing</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3 id="2-SNMP-Enumeration"><a href="#2-SNMP-Enumeration" class="headerlink" title="2. SNMP Enumeration"></a>2. <u>SNMP Enumeration</u></h3><p>By this, the attacker tries enumerating user accounts and devices on a target device using SNMP. SNMP holds two passwords to access and configure the SNMP agent from management station. Also the information regarding the hosts, routers, devices, ARP tables etc. can be extracted by enumeration.<br><br><b><u>Working of SNMP</u></b></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">1.

LDAP Enumeration"></a>3. <u>LDAP Enumeration</u></h3><p>LDAP protocol is used to access distributed directory services, mainly done in Windows operating system. Client createds a connection oriented LDAP session with Directory System Agent.<br>Communication is done between client and server using Basic Encoding Rules. Through LDAP enumeration, attacker can get valid user names, addresses etc.<br><br>The LDAP enumeration can be done with the following tools, and these are present in internet:</p><ol><li>LDAP admin tool.</li><li>LDAP account manager</li><li>Softerra LDAP administrator</li><li>LDAP search</li><li>Active directory explore</li></ol><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/ldapenum.PNG" alt="ldapenum"></p><h3 id="4-NTP-Enumeration"><a href="#4-NTP-Enumeration" class="headerlink" title="4.

So it is a bit different from the footprinting. Nowadays there are many different ways of getting such enumeraion, so this step is not difficult as it seems to be. You might get this step a bit boring, but when once you start getting some extra information you will find it interesting. Again it’s just a way of extracting some extra information about the target.</p><hr><hr><p>This blog was all about different types of enumeration, how it can be done, different tools that could be used in enumeration. So till now we are able to gain as much information possible about the target by footprinting, scanning and enumeration.<br><br>Now in the next blog I will start how to get into the system by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the target system.</p><!-- Credits for header pic https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%2FLinux-tutorials%2FEthical-Hacking-Enumeration%2F479403-2.html&psig=AOvVaw3UB3Y7h5wCGfZlRCmMDSMx&ust=1615482234889000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLiO3Lqapu8CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE -->]]></content>

TCP SYN Scan [-sS]</u></strong> <br><br>This scan is also known as stealth scan and a better option over <strong>TCP connect scan</strong>, because it does not performs <strong>three way handshake</strong> with the<br>target’s device, which is why it is also called half-open scan.

UDP is used for broadcasting,<br>therefore it is difficult to find that the host is alive or not, or if the packet was lost, because in UDP the acknowledgement is not sent from the server to<br>client. Most of the times <strong>ICMP_PORT_UNREACH</strong> error is sent back to client.

Once system is shutdown than all the process in the RAM ( Volatile Memory ) are removed.<br>We know that some malware resides in the memory of the system and if any process is also started by the malware then we can find it in the memory of the system. So this is the best option to dump the memory of the affected system and check the volatile memeory of that system to detect suspicous process,  files, even browser history and a lot of things </p><p>Now we know what is Memory Forensic we look how to do this with the FTK Imager Tool.</p><p>I am using sample of a memory dump used in TrollCat CTF to demostrate this.</p><p>After Downloading and installing the FTK imager we got a window of FTK Imager tool.</p><p><img src="/assets/FTK-Imager/AccessData-FTK-Imager.png" alt="ftk-window"></p><p>Go to file option and click on the add evidence option to add file in the FTK Imager to analyze it.</p><p><img src="/assets/FTK-Imager/export.PNG" alt="add file"></p><p>After importing file in the FTK Imager Toll on the left side i.e, EVIDENCE TREE we got all the Files, Dir detected by the Toll</p><p><img src="/assets/FTK-Imager/left-tree.png" alt="evidence tree"></p><p>Now start checking the Dir, Files loaded in the Evidence for the suspicous files. So if I continue with the same memory dump file so in this if we go to drive it have one zip <strong>TOPSECRET.ZIP</strong>.<br>Now we have to check what is inside this zip so for this <code>RIGHT CLICK -&gt; EXPORT FILES</code>.</p><p><img src="/assets/FTK-Imager/add-evidence.PNG" alt="export files"></p><p>In this way we an search the complete files which were on the system at the time of dumping memory.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/footprinting.jfif" alt="image1" height="400" width="900"/><caption>Image taken from <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Linux-tutorials/Ethical-Hacking-Footprinting-Reconnaissance/455717-2.html">here</a></caption><hr><p>In this blog I am going to show different ways to perform footprinting. Now for doing this you should have<br>Linux and Windows operating systems. For Linux operating system there are some tools which run on CLI, and<br>on windows operating system, there are some commands on CMD(command prompt) by which footprinting could be<br>done. Also there are some websites through which information gathering can be done about the victim.</p><hr><h2 id="CAUTION-For-practicing-hacking-always-try-for-these-two-websites"><a href="#CAUTION-For-practicing-hacking-always-try-for-these-two-websites" class="headerlink" title="CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:"></a><strong>CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li><li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways</strong><br><strong>will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t</strong><br><strong>you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking</strong><br><strong>something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep</strong><br><strong>a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.</strong></p><hr><h1 id="Information-Gathering-By-CMD-Commands"><a href="#Information-Gathering-By-CMD-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Information Gathering By CMD Commands"></a>Information Gathering By CMD Commands</h1><p><em>There are some commands in information gathering that you can try for other websites as well, but it is still adviced</em><br><em>not to try on them. Now let’s start with practical concept of footprinting.</em></p><h2 id="1-Tracert"><a href="#1-Tracert" class="headerlink" title="1. Tracert"></a>1. Tracert</h2><p><strong>Use:</strong> With this command you get the path(number of hops) to reach the website for which you are running this command.<br><br><strong>Syntax:</strong> tracert [URL of website]</p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/tracert.PNG" alt="tracert"></p><p>In above snapshot you could see that my packet needed 14 hops to reach the destination, i.e. certifiedhacker.com website.<br>Also you can see the “ *   *   * “ pattern in some places. This is due to fact that the  response from the router exceeded<br>the ttl(time to live), therefore no information regarding the router could be found. The tracert sends three packets, and<br>the round trip time is displayed of each packet. Round trip time is just a time taken for the packet to reach the destination<br>router and come back to our device. Also the tracert command gives the IP address of the website for which you are finding<br>route.</p><h2 id="2-Ping"><a href="#2-Ping" class="headerlink" title="2. Ping"></a>2. Ping</h2><p><strong>Use:</strong> With this command you get the IP address of target. Also you can find the maximum size of frame that is accepted at<br>         the server side which can help attackers during DOS attack.<br><br><strong>Syntax:</strong> </p><ol><li>ping [URL of website]</li><li>ping -f -l {size of frame} [URL of website] <br><br>The 1st syntax is normal pinging, where you will get the IP address of the website. In 2nd syntax “-f” “-l” are the options<br>which is used to specify the <strong>frame</strong> and <strong>length</strong> respectively and the <strong>{size of frame}</strong> is an integer which you can<br>change time to time until your frame gets discarded. By changing the values of the size of frame you get the boundry value<br>of the size of frame that is accepted at server side.</li></ol><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/ping.PNG" alt="ping"></p><h2 id="3-Nslookup"><a href="#3-Nslookup" class="headerlink" title="3. Nslookup"></a>3. Nslookup</h2><p><strong>Use:</strong> With this command you can get the information regarding the Domain Name System(DNS). Just type <strong>nslookup</strong> in cmd and<br>         press enter key. You will get a shell with “&gt;” symbol on left. Then you have to set various options depending upon the<br>         information you want. The options are-</p><ul><li><b>A</b>: For getting IP address.</li><li><b>ptr</b>: For name from IP address.</li><li><b>ns</b>: For getting name server.</li><li><b>cname</b>: For getting alias name.</li><li><b>SOA</b>: For getting Start Of Authority.</li></ul><p>These options are set in the shell in following manner-<br><strong>set type=[option name]</strong> then press enter to set the option.<br><strong>Type URL</strong> then press enter to get information regarding the option you set earlier.</p><p><strong>Syntax:</strong> nslookup</p><p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/nslookup.PNG" alt="nslookup"></p><h2 id="4-Advanced-Google-Search"><a href="#4-Advanced-Google-Search" class="headerlink" title="4. Advanced Google Search"></a>4. Advanced Google Search</h2><p>**Use:**Advanced google search, also known as <em>google hacking</em> is another way to extract sensitive or hidden information with the<br>help of complex search queries. Query can find some valuable data about the target from google search engine. This type of google<br>search gives more specific result about what you have searched, unlike normal searching where you get lakhs of links.<br>The operators in the search query used are-</p><ul><li><b>inurl:</b> This restricts the search results only to pages containing the word specified in the URL</li><li><b>intitle:</b> This operator restricts results to only those pages containing the specified term in the title</li><li><b>inanchor:</b> This operator results those pages containing query terms specified in the anchor text on link to the page</li><li><b>site:</b> Restricts search results to a specified site or domain</li><li><b>cache:</b> This operator displays google's cached version of a web page, instead of current version of the web page.</li><li><b>file by:</b> This operator provides the  search result with the specified file format specified by you after the operator.</li></ul>These are few operators used during google search. There are more operators, but these are mostly used during search.<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> operator:[link name or string depending on operator]<br><em>You should not have spaces between <strong>operator</strong>, <strong>:</strong> and <strong>search string</strong>. Also carefully look the number search results found by</em><br><em>this method and normal google search.</em></p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/googlehacking.PNG" alt="googlehacking"></h2><h1 id="Websites-That-Help-in-Information-Gathering"><a href="#Websites-That-Help-in-Information-Gathering" class="headerlink" title="Websites That Help in Information Gathering"></a>Websites That Help in Information Gathering</h1><p>There are several good websites that help in providing information regarding the target, such as- IP address, website first seen, DNS,<br>website archtecture, location of the server, port numbers open etc. These sites are also used by general public for security reasons,<br>so that they could not be fooled by anyone who is trying impersonate as someone else and trying to extract any information from them etc.</p><h2 id="1-Netcraft"><a href="#1-Netcraft" class="headerlink" title="1.

Netcraft</h2><p><a href="https://www.netcraft.com/">https://www.netcraft.com/</a><br><br>This is an amazing website where you just have to put the URL of the target website about whose information you want to gather. Then<br>automatically it will give you the information related to the website such as-</p><ul><li>Rank of site</li><li>When was the site first seen</li><li>Any risk on site</li><li>Hosting company</li><li>IP address</li><li>Nameserver</li><li>Domain registrar</li><li>Location of server</li><li>Server side technologies</li><li>Languages used at client side scripting</li></ul>Visit the site and try this website.

In this step the hacker tries to gain information regading<br>the victim or target. Now it depends upon the intensions of the hacker if he does for the benifit of some organization<br>or if he has some malicious intensions. The hacker gets the knowledge regarding the level of risk that a particular<br>organization has. The hacker tries to find the open source information as well as the crucial information about<br>the organization in which he will try to get into.<br>There are two types of footprinting-<br></p><ul><li> Active Footprinting </li><li> Passive Footprinting </li></ul><h2 id="Active-Footprinting"><a href="#Active-Footprinting" class="headerlink" title="Active Footprinting"></a>Active Footprinting</h2><p>In active footprinting the hacker directly interacts with the victim to gather information.

Data is so cheap nowadays that each and every person has the access of internet easily. Therefore, a<br>common person has all his contact numbers, photos, videos, important documents, notes, playlists, reminders etc. as<br>a backup on the internet. Somehow if the device gets compromized then this “backup” can be missused in several ways<br>depending on the attacker.<br>Huge amount of data is present in <em>cyberspace</em> and also being added every hour. Have an idea with the following fact<br>that what happens across the word in 60 seconds</p><img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/internerIn60secs.png" alt="image1" height="500" width="500"/><hr><p>Apart from above discussion, there are many other platforms on internet where people show their activity time to time.<br>Some of the data is confidential and some is open source. The Confidential data acts as the hack value, i.e. the hackers<br>are in need of such information that is not accessible by the unauthorized users and expect some ransom in return or<br>else they make it public, or missuse it to defame the owner of the information, which is a crime.<br>This brings the need of cybersecurity. This whole field deals with the various steps used by the cybersecurity personnel<br>in order to keep the cyberspace safe for the general public, to prevent the data from being accessed by unethical people,<br>and if it’s done then take the legal procedings against the attacker and fix the damages done by the attacker.</p><h3 id="Need-of-Ethical-Hackers"><a href="#Need-of-Ethical-Hackers" class="headerlink" title="Need of Ethical Hackers"></a>Need of Ethical Hackers</h3><p>The ethical hackers are the personnel who do hacking within the legal boundaries and don’t have intentions to harm anyone.<br>They help the organization by finding various vulnerabilities in their applications, websites and server; so that no one<br>could exploit any of those vulnerabilities and get control over the server or harm the organization in any other way.<br>For dealing with hackers the ethical hacker have to think like a black hat hackers(the attackers) and get into the server<br>by exploiting the vulnerabilities they found. Later they patch those vulnerabilities, discovered by them so that the<br>organization remains safe from any attacks. In general the hacking is done by performing following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Footprinting</strong></li><li><strong>Scanning</strong></li><li><strong>Enumeration</strong></li><li><strong>Gaining access into system</strong></li><li><strong>Maintaining that access</strong></li><li><strong>Clearing logs</strong></li></ol><p>A cybersecurity enthusiast and an ethical hacker knows a lot more than above six points. It’s not like if you have got<br>command somehow on these six points then you have mastered cybersecurity and have become an ethical hacker. The ethical<br>hacker and a cybersecurity personnel have to keep himself updated regarding the latest bug found, the latest case studies<br>related to any cyber crime, and also has the knowledge in the networking field. Linux is mandatory if you want to become<br>an ethical hacker. There are over 1000 commands in linux and each commannd has several options. It’s impossible to mugup<br>the commands in linux, rather you should have a hands-on practice with most of the commands. Afterall it’s all about practicing<br>things. In networking you should have the knowledge of atleast subnetting, IP addressing, TCP/OSI model, devices used in<br>establishing a network and various protocols. Means these concepts are the prerequisite for being an ethical hacker.</p><hr><p>In my upcoming blogs, the networking and linux’s basic concepts will not be covered. This series will be dedicated only to<br>the above six points and will be elaborated with all the tools and linux commands. If you are new to this and don’t have<br>any prior knowledge about networking and linux, not to worry about. Each point will be discussed in detail, and surely you<br>will find interesting stuffs related to hacking.</p><!--Credits for header pic https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%2FLinux-tutorials%2FFootprinting-reconnaissance%2F455717%2F5027599-4.html&psig=AOvVaw3a8Q0jqD8nFs_ch1h8rqJL&ust=1615481919393000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCICK5aqZpu8CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Friends, In todays blog I will tell how to host CTF for free on the <strong>ctfd</strong> with the <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Digital Ocean provide free <strong>100$ Credit</strong> to every new user for one time. </p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a></p><p>We will use these credits for hosting our CTF.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE : You will only get credits if you have credit card or paypal account. </p></blockquote><p>But there is also one way by which you can take credits is that if you have debit card and have international ON on it then it will also work.</p><p>So after creating account you just have to go to home page and click on the Get started with a droplet.</p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/1.png" alt="info"></p><p>After this you will get options to choose the OS you want the configuration you want and password you can set for the ssh login.</p><p>So from my experience ubuntu is good with 18.04* with configuration of </p><ul><li>4 CPUs </li><li>5 TB Transfer</li><li>160 GB SSD </li></ul><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/2.png" alt="info"></p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/3.png" alt="info"></p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/4.png" alt="info"></p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/5.png" alt="info"></p><p>Then click on the CREATE DROPLET option.</p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/6.png" alt="info"></p><p>when the droplet is build you will get your IP.</p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/8.png" alt="info"></p><p>Now login into machine you hosted with the SSH ( creds are the username : root and password : &lt; you choosed while creating &gt; )</p><p>Firstly update and upgrade</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It will take sometime to update the system after this we have to install the <strong>docker</strong> and <strong>docker-compose</strong>.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">apt install docker docker-compose</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/11.png" alt="info"></p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/10.png" alt="info"></p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/12.png" alt="info"></p><p>After this just visit CTFD deployment website there also you get all the steps how to do.</p><p><a href="https://docs.ctfd.io/docs/deployment/">CTFD DEPLOYMENT</a></p><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/13.png" alt="info"></p><p>Now just open the tmux session by typing <strong>tmux and press enter</strong>.</p><p>So we will git clone the ctfd repo first and then do the further steps.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git <span class="built_in">clone</span> https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><img src="/assets/CTF_HOST/14.png" alt="info"></p><p>Now move to the CTFD dir and open the <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong> file.
